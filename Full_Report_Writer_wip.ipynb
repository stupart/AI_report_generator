It's about the human biomes, all aquifers specifically. Many aquifers on the radius of more than 1 of the biomes. So on a portfolio management approach, a portfolio approach, sorry. It would be very interesting to understand how you could establish, for example, has to be 40% on the Amazon, but it can be on the other items at the same portfolio. But it would be strategic, because otherwise it would be very, we, for example, we invest a lot on micro forestry, but we use Atlantic Way Forest as our sandbox for the Amazon. Well, CSEARCH established there just to analyze and then put the blaze in the Amazon.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (10966.19): Yeah, let's talk. There's no hard-pass rules. We can explore and talk about it and see what's possible.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (10974.81): And I think now I am forced to tell everybody it's time for lunch.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (10978.01): So lunch is right around the corner, right? OK, so\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (10981.75): my job is to send you all there, correct?\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (10983.55): It is Mark's job to send you.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11008.45): Okay, folks, we have food ready to go and we have somebody that's on a tight schedule to say a few words to us. So if you could proceed as quickly as you can, grab some food and then grab a seat and then we'll proceed with the first speaker.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (11188.33): Great metaphor I'm going to use it all the time, but I'll try to use it at least half the time. It's a bathtub, right? All the stuff's coming into the bathtub and we need to close down the spigot. We need to quickly figure out how to turn the water off, right? Because bad stuff's coming out of the faucet. However, there is some good stuff already in the bathtub, but we can't afford to lose any of it. We cannot afford to lose any more water out of the bathtub. So part of it is maybe the conservation piece, which I don't think we have economically figured out yet. I don't think we have the right to. We talked a lot about concessional capital, all 3. But the answer was as simple as we have enough for 15, maybe 20 years, and you name the sector, and for the last 3 it's been around energy, which by the way isn't that hard to bank on, because it's pretty easy to get revenue streams coming out of massive billion-dollar wind farms. And even then, it's the same conversation. Versus trying to figure out ways to do bioeconomy in the rural depths of the Amazon. So if we're asking the same question as, where's the concessional capital? We're gonna start thinking about new innovative solutions because obviously over 15 years, we haven't cracked that nut. 1 of the ideas we've been talking about a little bit, and again, super uninformed, is that there's time-bound capital in this capital stack. That maybe the point is, we have to do much better collectively than we have. And it's a bit of a naysayer kind of thing. The 1.5 alive and Secretary Kerry. It's real. Sometimes we go on the kind of the scary speech. Sometimes we go on the motivating speech. Sometimes we do a little bit of both. We have to figure out much better. Listen to God. We've got to push ourselves. We've got to push, like I say, all my DSC colleagues all the time. I want to fail a little. If you ever grew up skiing, like I'm from the Pacific Northwest, if you don't fall down, you never get better. You have to fall down. We have to figure out some more innovative, risky type solutions to figure out who can take that loss. Because I'm hearing very clearly, you guys can't. You have rules, you got jobs. We got rules, we got jobs. We got investment committees. No one's going to say, all right, take a stupid risk. But we're all going to need to take smarter, different risks. And that's what I think this is about today, the next 2 days, and quite frankly, for the entirety of my 4 years in Brazil, we'll try to push on that envelope. So we, USAID, want to bring some tools. We want to have a new kind of toolbox, beginning to be at the ready to some level, I guess, buy off risk through technical assistance. That's why PowerXPro was actually created. That's why it's a presidential level initiative. Someone stood back and said, wow, that's a really complicated problem set. And we have 12 government agencies who play in this space. Having 12 government agencies aligned is not the same as having 12 government agencies work together. And then we brought on 20 partners, like the World Bank, like IFC, like 40,000 or 30,000 megawatts, 60 million connections. That's it. So to some extent we got to go back to the simple and understand what what is we need to do, how much do we need to stop deforestation at a pace like that. So we all have to figure out a way to get together. But let's simplify it, then we need to put the complication down at the right level to get a new, innovative, risky project. All to say is, I said it earlier in the first session, sometimes we complicate things a bit when we talk to you. I was following that chart. I was a little lost. Like, damn, that's\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11189.03): a tough job. I've been\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (11257.51): doing it for 2 decades. So, we can take on to make sure we understand how to work better together, whether it's connecting AEDFC or it's connecting AED in Washington or AED Brazil to AED Peru. Don't worry about it. We'll have the conversations. Bring the good idea. Don't lose sight of the good idea. Don't try to change it. That simple. Let's share what we can. Understand that your competitors on some level, some of you, but you're also collaborators. At the end of the day, it's not, you know, there's plenty of widgets to sell, as it were, in the other metaphor. There's plenty of space for everyone to get, I think, a ton of investments in the Amazon, whether it be for nature-based solutions, whether it be for bioeconomy, whether it be for other kinds of carbon. So let's try to leave with 8, 10, 12 actual good specific ideas, not just pontifications. And let's write them down, and then we'll try to figure out a way to keep the network learning. There's networks or knowledge networks already sitting next to 1 of them in the in the room maybe we use those we don't need to reinvent the wheel someone mentioned UK is doing something cool in bioeconomy I took a note I will go call my UK colleagues and say I understand you're trying to work on biodiversity credits. I want to, too. I don't want to reinvent the wheel. Because there's not enough time or money or space for all of us to go to them.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11257.85): So we\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (11298.17): have to go together. And I think this is our first attempt, with the finance being the entry point, to talk about what's important. You're but 1 entry point, but you're absolutely the super important 1. And you're the gateway to a much larger 1 that is going to make our 9000000000 and everyone else's Amazon fund levels look like paltry sums, because it's gonna take a lot more to get the job done. Thank you so much. Please continue to push all of us. A, DFC state colleagues, raise your hand 1 more time, please. Every 1 of these people is super creative and smart. Trust me. Ask them, push them. If they're the wrong person, they're going to point you to someone else. And then we've got a whole team standing behind us in Peru and in Washington and Brazil and elsewhere as well.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11298.31): Thank\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (11310.93): you very much.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (11316.51): Don't forget your phone. We have\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11348.93): until half past the hour and then we need to move over into the other room. So there's dessert here and there's hopefully coffee somewhere to caffeinate everybody. And then we're going to jump into the fun poster making act. Is that I said yesterday, we want to have everybody go into that state that you remember from when you were a child. We're going to be\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11351.19): making drawings.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11356.75): And the reason we're doing this, We call it serious play.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11357.07): We're going\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11360.89): to play in a way, but it's very serious,\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11363.65): because we're here for a serious reason.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11400.81): 1 of the things that humans are really good at is telling stories. And what we don't want is every 1 of you to make a PowerPoint presentation. Not that there's anything wrong with PowerPoint, but it would get very sleepy in here. So we're not going to get sleepy. We're going to get energetic. And we're going to do that by creating something, a vehicle, a visual way to help you figure out how you want to tell your story, and then also give everybody a chance to present their story to\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11402.81): everybody else. So in\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11404.87): the United States,\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11405.35): in high\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11406.71): school, sometimes\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11407.09): you don't\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11409.47): have to do it. And you go to science class,\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (11410.81): you do your experiment.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11411.13): And then\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11426.93): we have a thing called a science fair. Everybody has their experiment in the gymnasium and you stand by your experiment and everybody walks around and you tell your story about your experiment and it's very exciting. That's what we're going to do.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11427.27): We're going\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11448.18): to do that. You're going to create your poster today and then 1 group will go after today, 1 group will go and make their presentations, and then tomorrow we have 2 groups, so we're going to break you again into 3 groups. Let's say the same 3 groups, okay?\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (11453.73): Cool.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11474.75): Cool. So before we get started with that, in front of you there's a blank piece of paper and if you can grab 1 of those markers, 1 of those black markers and I just want you to, I want you to go and play with me please.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11475.19): Okay. Here's what\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11489.57): I want you to do. So what we want to share, This is the purpose\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11491.11): of this activity. You're going\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11509.33): to create a poster, and we want you to talk about a specific investment model, or a framework, or a program that you, your organization, has worked on, is working on, or is getting ready to work on it. So it's a story around investment models. 20 parts.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11511.61): For projects.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11627.17): And we want you to talk about an innovative aspect of that. That can be the model itself, the co-benefits, the governance structure, equity, success factors, those types of things. And then we also want you to highlight any solutions for achieving that sustainable climate objective. And the outcomes towards the forest and land sector. And then obviously the financial returns because that's how the world goes around. Yep. So that's what we're going to ask you to build a model about. But before we do that, I want to bring you back to your inner child. And I'm going to tell you a little bit about visual thinking. I want you to think visually. The first thing I want you to do is I want you to make these little squigglies. You start making them. OK. It doesn't matter. Just a closed little cloud. OK? And then I'm going to show you some magic. I'm going to put a little triangle here, and a little dot there, and then I'm going to put a little triangle here and then these little things. And all of a sudden we have a chicken or a bird. Here's another bird over here. You can do it. Go ahead. Make your little birds. It's very, it's very relaxing. Any squiggle can become a bird. Here's a little bird that...\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11632.35): Let us know if you don't have fans, okay? Yes.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11636.99): And here's a bird, I'm going to make this bird fly.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11637.39): I'm going to put\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11642.63): a wing\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11648.65): here, and that little bird flies.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11659.41): I am NOT a good drawer. I am NOT an artist. You're an excellent engineer. Yes, I am an engineer from past life.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11662.05): Guilty. And you are a lawyer.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11808.09): It's almost as bad an insult. Okay. Alright, so that's kind of fun. But a good friend of mine, Dave Gray, he's written a bunch of books. He says, if your ideas can't be drawn, they cannot be done. And if you don't believe that, let me tell you a little bit of the answer. Way back in the 1960s, President Kennedy and some really smart engineers were asking for some very brave people to go to the moon. Okay, yes, sure, I'll do that. I'm a fighter pilot, sure. But explain to me how you are going to do this, right? So, this is a hand-drawn picture. Somebody said, we are going to put you on the most powerful thing that man has ever made. It's a bomb, a nuclear bomb. And we will basically strap you to that at the top of it, and you will go around the Earth. And then at some point, after you've gone around a few times, we're going to hit the accelerator, and we're going to shoot you to the moon. And then when you get up there, you're going to land. The first time they weren't landing, of course. And then we will use the momentum to take you back to Earth. And then trust us, when you come back to Earth, we're going to figure out how to get you back on Earth alive. But remember, nobody's ever done this before, right? So it's all done by sketching And engineers like myself you were like okay. This is 1110,000 pounds you know they've calculated everything they have to do this all by drawing to communicate their ideas yeah So I'm going to give you a little language I kid you not this is your language for communicating today. A triangle, and then a little squiggly Cloud like you just did with your chickens, and if you want to go to the more advanced language And of course this is nothing special. There's a dot another line an arc an unclosed check triangle a little swirl A little swirl, another kind of swirl, a circle, an American football, yes. And a triangle, another rectangle, and then a, what do you call it? Anybody?\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11810.25): A house. Yes, I think.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11817.97): A house. All right, so all of these things can be combined into a community. Give you some examples.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11819.55): What is that?\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11839.87): Okay, so there are different ways you can do this. This is the advanced stick figure, right? Because it has some expression. It's a happy person. That's another way. With the little box and the feet and the hair, right? You can now see where the person is looking. The little starfish?\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (11841.39): I don't like the starfish, but you can use it\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (11842.63): if you want to.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (11890.49): And then this is the computer animated person head. What does this person mean? Not happy. What does this person mean? Curious. So It's really easy, really easy if you just free yourself to communicate. This is a meeting. You know, if you put some words down here, Then all of a sudden you have a picture and some words to help communicate. And then finally, nobody ever understands what I'm drawing here. But this is me at my desk. This is me going outside and being happy. So here I have a smile, and there I'm not smiling. So do you think you can do this?\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (11893.85): Okay, good.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

That's the secret.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (11944.89): I don't know how to do this.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12081.71): I don't know how to move my legs. You like what you see? You like what you see? That's enough. Before it was... I'm going to be a tree. ARBCDEFGHKLMNMMMI would like to be a tree, a cat, a tree, a cat, a tree, a tree, a cat, a tree, a tree, and like that. So I'm happy to give you a very small gift. A cat. Right? Thank you. Is that OK? Yeah. It's cool. I'll write a title here. It's really interesting. And a plan. He's in a plan. Right? Yeah. OK. We actually have a part that's already in the house. We have another 1 in the office. But we don't know yet.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (12088.41): Hi, Dad. Just a whistle, please. Whistle? Yeah.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12113.79): OK. So guys, fantastic work. I love it. I'm not going to cry. I'm so happy to see everybody. I know even Daniel got into the act. Very good, Daniel. He's getting super creative. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to go on a generous 20-minute break. Okay? Just relax, do some whale, call your mom, call your\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12179.21): daughter. Over here? I'll get some help. Thank you for having us. I don't think you can make it. Yeah, I know. That's fine. I know. I know. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12334.89): Okay. If everybody could, if we could have the people who are presenting go by their poster please. People who are presenting go by your poster. Thank you. Everybody, we're going to get started with the poster presentations. You could stand next to your poster if you're presenting. Isaac? Isaac? If you could... You need to stand over there, please, next to your poster. Who's presenting? Presenting. The twos and the threes are the audience. The ones are presenting. And I think we have... Okay, I'm over here. Okay. Is everybody ready to play the game? Play along. Seriously, we're going to have the people who are ones stand by your poster. You need some tape over there. And what we're going to do is we're going to ask everybody who's not a 1 to go and distribute so that you have 2 or 3 people in front of each poster and being the audience. Is that? OK. OK. The ones are presenting to the twos and the threes. So we need to have at least 2 people in front of each as an audience, the 39 presenters. Yeah, we need to get some we need to get some\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12336.67): And if you have some changes, thank you for\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12339.93): following my audio. We're going to give Post-it notes for feedback.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12350.21): No, I'm just saying, like, is it possible to unify our audience so we have, like, a large audience for both projects? Because here's 2 separate stations.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12352.95): Well, you need to just do 1 at a time.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12356.81): Okay, perfect. But it should be the same people listening.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12369.79): If you're doing 2 projects, you need to have either a separate station or you need to be not a 1, but somebody needs to be a 2 and go tomorrow. Okay, so 1 of you can go tomorrow.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12389.76): No, no, no. Sorry. You are 1 and you are a 2. No, no. No, I'm sorry. He's 1 vote and I'm 1 vote. I'm another vote. Do you need further report? No, I'm just saying like there's a lot of time. I'm just like, I'm just saying vote for them. And if you like, it's like,\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (12391.49): no, check you don't, you just throw the money.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12414.17): Yeah, I will see. Don't make me win. I know, I know. 1000000 dollar grant from USID, something like that. Not bad, not bad. I'll take that. Okay, shall we all ask.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12562.11): Okay. Okay, folks. Folks. Okay. We're going to do this the first time. Please. Please. We're going to do this the first time. I realize it's a little bit confusing once we've done it 1 time and 2 times It's gonna be Very easy for everybody so the people who are ones are going to be talking So the people who are the audience the twos and the threes should be clear nearby those people like that you're embracing the play. I love that. That's just a drill. Okay. So, so because there's so many people going to be talking at once, you need to be near the person who's presenting. Okay? It's going to get loud. I will put 4 minutes, and when I, when 4 minutes is up, then the audience, my colleagues are going to pass out sticky notes and Sharpies. And you can then write down your feedback on those sticky notes and put them on the blank piece of paper. Your feedback, your questions, your comments, I really love the drawings. Or what a great financial model, exclamation point, or something like that. I don't know. I have no idea. Whatever. OK. So if you could, if you got, can I ask all the ones to raise your hand all the ones the presenters Okay? Okay. So do you guys know what to do? Okay, okay, so I'm gonna say go And then you start presenting and then when I get back on the microphone, and I say stop Then you're just going to stop talking Okay, and this is important Because you want people to ask you questions and you say, okay, what else? Or if they give you feedback, you can respond. But remember, when you're responding, you're not getting feedback. You're not getting any ideas. So try to ask, say, I understand that question, and then you put it up. Or I understand that comment. That way in 4 minutes you can get a lot of stuff. If you start responding, you can burn all of the 4 minutes up in 1 response. So just keep that in mind. So no total of 4 minutes and then we're going\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12563.17): to be rotating. You'll have\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12567.19): 4 minutes to present and 4 minutes for feedback.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12568.23): I know this is hard\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12619.95): the first time and the second time, but the third time it'll be a breeze. Okay? Ready, Ready, go.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12779.91): What is the solution? We are facing problems with the telecommunications sector, I don't know how to say it in English, but we are facing a lot of problems. But for us to do this, these companies, this infrastructure, you have to recognize that you can't have externalities, there are externalities that are now part of the business model. When You We can only bring a future cashier to the present to finance this change. There is no more cashier, it will not happen. It's just a possibility. Here you don't have cash, you don't have cash in the bank. Here there is an expectation of cash flow that must be good in the present. What we do... 1 of the things we put in our project is that we can't say that we're developing high-speed climbing. So... We have 7 farmers, they are cattle producers, they do beef. We have other crops, cotton, orange, soy. What is needed now? 1 major problem that we face now is that\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (12790.57): this operation is costly because it comes with a technical system,\\n[Speaker:0] (12809.59): So basically the cost of the operation is very high. We're getting to know everybody and how everybody works.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (12810.51): And I just look at my\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (12866.29): computer screen and I'm starting to understand what DFC means. DFC knowing that DHC6 can deliver. And then, you can see, as an anchor for all of us, all of the people that are in the community. I like to even them, the\\n[Speaker:1] (12868.39): students, talking to them,\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13110.27): trying to teach them these different approaches and I want to invite, for example, partners and organizations that are experts in Amazon issues, to share their vision and actually what are the problems in the Amazon, the challenges, what are the opportunities, what the Amazon needs, what kind of money the Amazon needs, because We have to believe that that was made. We will have 5 times less water use than the regular milk. You have 6 times less grazing area than the 1 regular kind of milk. And you have 23 times less carbon emissions or greenhouse gas emissions than the other kind of milk. And the producer makes between 8 and 10 times more than the producer. Yeah, this is the example coming from the large corporation demands. We also had a table where the representatives of the small and medium farms organize themselves to rehabilitate and keep up lines and to start to professionalize and to get the level of that they did, either as cores or either as a stand that they have an opportunity to get together there. So we did that project in Paraj\\u00f3, it's in Par\\u00e1, with the cooperative. And Paradura has an important role here, in fact in the state policy. ...Or something like that. What we want is to show that there's a reason for the rundown of how they can decide. What we want to stimulate and what we're doing like to investigate and to have a more coordinated money. It's like a co-design, a co-design, a co-reading. It's nice to get favorable terms for good environmental outcomes. Yeah. So, do you have some minimal size figure you've been working with in terms of producers. It's quite a lot of fun. We have a lot of products in all sizes. We have like a 3x3,\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (13130.77): a 2x2, and we also have a 2x2. In this operation we have 7 users.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13148.17): Okay, now time for feedback. Time for feedback.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (13156.27): Sorry, we have to get, we have to, we want to let you out on time. And we have some more things we'd like to first.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (13158.31): Get some\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (13197.57): feedback very quickly. And then we have a few things we'd like to dig deeper into. So if I could get everybody to grab a seat, that would be awesome. Please. Okay. What was that like? What did you enjoy then? Was that engaging? Yeah? And the pictures, did you see some wonderful explanations? Great. I'm gonna hand it over to Reem. We're gonna land the plane today for the day.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13283.23): Okay, so thank you all very much. I realize that's a lot to cram into 4 minute presentations, but what was very, very clear in those 4 minute presentations and in the conversations that followed, that there are some really great actionable models that are currently in use or that are about to go live. We have a lot of really practical solutions that are, some of them in some cases, are really tested already, right? So what I would ask is that, I know we talked briefly about these idea cards this morning, they're the green papers on your tables. If you were in group 1, and you would like to make sure that you have a follow-up conversation with the US government about your model. Take a minute before you leave today to jot down the things you think are important about that model and what you'd like to share with them and we'll make sure that it goes to back to USAID, to DFC, to the State Department so that they can see what we would like to share with them. We will also be just taking photos of all of the models themselves, the pictures. So just make sure you tie your name on your card to your poster so we can match them at the end. But we'll just use these idea cards to help capture in a little bit more depth how your models are working. I think that's something also where as we start to move through tomorrow, again, the twos and the threes will have a chance to do their presentations tomorrow. Yeah.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (13286.65): Yeah. Sorry. I don't know.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (13288.19): It's okay. Just for\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13288.77): a second.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13290.47): I thought I heard.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (13292.07): Yes. The green ones. Yes.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13292.55): The green ones.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (13300.67): I forgot to say. I must have called. Okay. Those green ones, It's what we have to do is to put on our ideas or on the analyzer here.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13307.91): No, it's if you were a 1 and you were presenting. Oh. And you would like to then have a further conversation about your model.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (13311.13): Okay. I'm talking. Okay.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13312.95): Were we supposed to have gone through 8\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13320.97): different things? You probably went through just half. And that is just part of the nature of the space tech. Okay, got it.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13321.31): This is\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (13367.47): a little bit more of a conversation I had with the organizers. We're going to talk tomorrow about taking themes and making it more thematic and figure out how to look at the ecosystem. But it struck me that there's going to be 24 really good specific ideas. And often the challenge is getting down to specifics, not necessarily getting up to themes. They're both important ways to go about, you know, trying to solve the problem. So selfishly, as we said earlier, we're looking to design toolboxes and we're looking to be very uniquely useful to you all in a very specific way, not in a general way, but how can the US government help you? So if you think there's something to your idea that has an obstacle that the US government can help you solve, that's why you put it on a green card. And we will have a follow-up conversation about your idea to see if we can iterate around it at a programmatic level. So, obviously, as well, we're gonna look at all the ideas together and figure\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13368.27): out which themes that we\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (13423.09): can then design around to be more useful to you as an ecosystem. But in this case, specifically you as an individual, we were talking here at the table, 10 years. I've been doing this for 10 years. Well, maybe we can solve that 10-year problem. If we can design something around what we have to offer, it's useful. Like a statutory level, on a risk mitigation level, on a technical systems capacity level, so on and so forth. So I just didn't want to lose today and then tomorrow groups 2 and 3, 24 already really well thought out, specific, cooked up ideas, and just lose it and have it divine back down again from a thematic O. We're talking about concessionary capital. We're talking about... So both are valid and very useful ways to go about solving. We didn't want to lose sight of this 1.

It's a self-selected, you got to do the green card.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13460.45): Yeah, and again, You're not required to do a green card, but this is really a cool opportunity to be able to have that conversation. The other thing I will note is that we will do 2 rounds of this tomorrow morning, have a little bit more of a plenary discussion about where are we seeing common issues that I think could also help feed into the way that\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (13462.55): the US government thinks about its programming.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

And so I just want to make sure that we're kind of building in some of these conversations around what do your models look like, where are there specific opportunities for collaboration or for support from the tools that this government offers. So that's just how we will work through this tomorrow. Hopefully we will\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (13490.75): come out of it\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13545.07): as something that's useful both for you, who are participants in the room, and also for our guests, our mentors, specifically. All right. So, it is now a little after 4, and I think our goal is to make sure that everybody has a chance to kind of wrap up their day and not stay late. We did want to however talk about some of the things that did come out of this morning in particular and some of the conversations that we had. Key themes, again, These may or may not be specific to your model, but I do think that across the board, in each of the conversations that Rick, Christy, and I sat in, so with USAID, with DSC, and the State Department, There were some common conversations that happened around the table and some things that happened in all 3 rounds. And so we can dig into this a little bit.\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (13546.65): And I want to know if these hold true\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13573.97): to the focus group. Does this feel like things you want to do as governments? You know. Okay. So the first theme that came across in some of our conversations was the nuances of the Brazilian market. Okay, so for a lot of us, this is a much more sophisticated financial market than a lot of places that we work. Some of the comments we heard is that, this market is very personalized,\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (13576.07): right? And relationship driven.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13585.75): The locations where we are, whether that is Sao Paulo versus Brasilia, you know, those matter, right? And So building those relationships is important and a step we need to continue\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (13587.83): thinking about. And also\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (13848.12): that there are, that's a very bright light, some specific kind of tools in place in the Brazilian market like types of bonds that are specific to Brazil. So thinking through those nuances of the Brazilian market and figuring out how to adapt the services and tools that the US government offers to this market specifically is something that may be both a challenge, but also a really interesting opportunity to help spur those partnerships that we're so interested in forming. So I will pause there just after this first 1. Does that ring true for the folks in the room? Generally, yes. This is also your opportunity to build on that or comment if you would like. Both participants and our US government folks. You don't have to. You can say, Rhi, I've been doing this for 6 and a half hours and I don't want to comment. Okay. The next thing that we saw as a kind of a key theme that ran through all 3 of the conversations this morning was this conversation around where the opportunities are and what geographies the US government is focused on. And so we're coming at this from a couple of different coordinating factors. So in some cases, where the US government can invest is really dependent on where its funding comes from and how and where it's allowed to spend it. However, I think it was very clear in a lot of these conversations that there are opportunities, yes, in the Amazon, but also in other parts of Brazil, other biomes that also have a potential, both climate, conservation, land use potential. And so thinking through, are there opportunities both to continue to focus on work in the Amazon, but also are there ways to build portfolios that allow for more geographic coverage, shall we say, is something that folks seem to be interested in having further discussions about. I don't know how feasible that is for the US government, particularly when there are certain types of funding that are constrained to the Amazon. But it may potentially be of interest to folks like CFDA if you have a little bit more of a broader ability to be looking for climate smart investments beyond certain congressional earmarks. So I don't know if anybody has any kind of reactions to that, if it was something people felt strongly about or just something that came up frequently. Okay, The third theme that I think has arisen in these conversations is really a pretty stark differentiation and kind of a split in terms of what participants are looking for, whether that is patient capital or concessional capital. And I think this does actually provide a really interesting window into where there might be opportunities for collaboration with different parts of the US government. So we do have a lot of groups that are looking for concessional capital to get a project started or to do some early stage work. That maybe they need that to be paired with technical assistance. Maybe they're looking for something early stage. That may align closely with some of the work that USAID might be looking at doing and funding. Conversely, we had 1 really great comment, and maybe it was Jose who said it, but I don't want to put you on the spot, which was, you know, I don't need cheap capital. I need patient capital, right? These are long-term projects. The investments we need to make in forests take a long time to come to fruition. And so the fact that DFC can offer very long loan tenors with that ability to just wait it out and wait for a return becomes really important in this space, particularly when we're talking about the speed at which trees grow. And so that was just something to really be thinking about is where is it appropriate and when do we want to ask for that concessional capital, when do we want to be thinking about closer to market rate, just but patient capital. So I'll pause again if that feels... Mark, go ahead.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (13848.77): I have a question on\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (13913.37): that 1. We talked earlier about capital recycling quicker. Where does guarantees fit into that in terms of another mechanism to buy down risk, right? I mean, to some extent you can add up all the risk, figure out how much it costs you to get that risk, your cost of capital, and figure out your X point. Or you can say, like we often say in a lot of these spots, the whole point of our development credit guarantee in the very beginning was we think no 1 really understands the risk or is willing to take a chance to understand the risks. And we think it's a pretty good investment, ergo we'll take the chance that it fails, but if it doesn't fail you don't get any free ride, right? To some extent it's the opposite side of concessional capital. Say, we can't give you cheaper capital, but if you truly believe it's risky, and that's why you're building your capital stack a certain way, and you're trying to get to x percent, you go X percent a little bit less because there's not really risk there. Can we take that on? I haven't heard a whole lot about guarantees or guarantees in different parts of the project in there.\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (14031.23): I think it depends on the type of what. Okay, Let's say, for example, we're talking about why we call it India Resort. Guarantees for credit access are very important, Because actually, in Peru, people used to pay 67% interest rates for the small cooperatives working there. Now, the question is, the type of banks or businesses that are going to structure these guarantees or make a guarantee might be too expensive with, let's say, a DFC value to structure something like that, unless you have really a very big scale, which is not really the case with the bioeconomy in the Amazon. Now, if it is my view that the values for innovation on a larger scale, the kind of technology or business on a commodity that can sell exports and dollars, then maybe the validity of the EFC is going to be attractive. So I think validities are very important. But the type of resources you put in the guarantees, if it is a first loss or a guarantee that can take a lot of risk because the type of people who take finance are risky, not the activity, but the value chains. That's 1 kind of problem. And the cost of capital and the risk and the time it takes and people who are managing that is relatively not so sophisticated, no? So that's 1 kind of problem, and the values are very important, But they cannot have the same cost and functionality than the other type of valetees where you can have that kind of modernization and carbon results and so on. But the company is a bit bigger and can sell products outside. So I think this is an important thing also for us to consider the kind of conversation on where to use positionality, why positionality is not so important.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (14039.45): More aggregate potentially the smaller riskier into a pool where you can take a diversified portfolio loss and if you can figure out how to pick it.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (14039.79): I mean, I'd\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (14057.81): love to have that conversation with anybody at some point about where we could potentially go with that. I think there's something there. I mean, the whole idea of a credit guarantee in the beginning was, there's a lack of capacity at the financial institution as well to properly register the risk and price the risk, right? And we're saying if we could teach the bank while we also guarantee it.\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (14096.17): Yeah. Brazil is very bad with guarantees. I used to work in the American Development Bank, so I did a lot of things in Mexico, with credit guarantees on all sorts of things and also in Colombia. This is very difficult with regulation for funds to be structured and offer guarantees. So that's another issue to take into account. You need to look at the regulatory approach as well to allow higher risks, because most of the guarantees we have here are from development banks or from private banks. And they are very traditional. They are not very innovative in terms of what kind of, for example, performance risks they would take and so on.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (14240.13): I'd just like to add something to what Maria has said. We don't have guarantees. And for us, I totally agree with you. We are terribly pricing risk in Brazil. And when you talk about bioeconomy and so on, we are very conservative. We prefer not to invest and to price up the risk. We prefer not to invest. It's a question of high investments, not to have a more expensive capital. It's just not to engage. But I have 2 other layers that I think I could add on the discussion. The first 1, there's a lot of different businesses in which the collateral that can be provided are not recognized by the market by the investor as a fiscal guarantee. When you look at, for example, our business, give me a light. It's a question of, I want some real assets guarantee. It's what's most understood by everyone. I want a physical guarantee. It's easier to execute. If not, it's a fiction. But it's how we imagined our financial sector. So to have those guarantees, it can be very supportive for not stress the end borrower providing collateral that they do not have. They can use those collaterals for other credits that they have access, not on the capital markets credit, for example. And another layer that I think is critical for us to understand is the soft powers of the guarantees. If I provide a guarantee under my name, it's very different from having a guarantee from the US government. The perception is the same guarantee, but to have the name US government reduces the risks absolutely. We have driven some Fox Group with some of our investors after we heard about the DFC to understand what was their sensitivity when you put guarantee and US carbon guarantee. The difference was astonishing. Not only about the price, but also the discussion. When I said, oh, I have a 100% guarantee. OK, but tell me more about those guarantees. I have a US guarantee. OK, I want it. There was no discussion. So it's almost like, OK, it's a risk-free operation, finally. I've heard that hypothetically. Now it do exist. So we can't disconsider that as well, the soft power of the US brand.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (14279.07): And just to add something, 1 main source of capital that we do have is our clients, because we need to prepay for credits. However, we struggle with giving them guarantees as well. And there are US clients, we need to acquire cheaper credits, because they are giving advance payment, upfront payment. So we have an issue with letter of credits because we do not have collateral. Because if you are having trouble using land that is for agriculture use as collateral imagine forests. Bans\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (14279.95): just yeah\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (14305.63): they look at me and say you're crazy. I can't do nothing with forests. So my main bottleneck is it's not capital, it's guarantee. Because if I have a guarantee, I can have concessional capital with Brazilian Development Bank, I can have capital with my clients, and I can have capital with even other types of financing.\\n[Speaker:5] (14357.17): That's useful. I mean, to some extent, like the example back here, a sale venture. When there's an inefficiency already in the system, and this seems like a market inefficiency, right? Banks unable to assess risk, people unwilling to bet on success. That's an easier problem usually to solve, then there's not actually any juice to squeeze, right? I mean, to some extent we can gain efficiencies within the models by using the guarantee if we're willing to bet on success. So for me, it's a good problem to have in the sense that we can innovate around that. We've done this in a lot of spots. It'll take some understanding clearly. Well, it'll take some understanding clearly as to regulatory environment, how to do it, and which we're looking at. It's not going to be simple by any stretch, but I think this is a conversation worth having because on an economic sense, there's juice to squeeze here. A lot of things we're always trying to squeeze juice, but there's nothing actually there. I just hope we can figure out a way to get more money in the\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (14406.07): system. Just to make a very quick comment, all those focus groups that we Managed to understand if the FC was competitive or not for us because we were introduced to you in New York so we were more exposed to the Rooms of engagement and so we understand the cost of the capital. There was already a fund that represented a term sheet for this fund saying that if there was provided EFC grant guarantee, the reduction would be 2 points. Well, 2 percent. So that is a very factual result of just the assumption that maybe sometimes, maybe, okay, let's reduce the 2 points in case of that happening. Okay? Same board's name?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (14407.61): Guarantees and insurance.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (14409.27): Insurance, yeah, insurance, same vote.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (14409.89): Yep, thank\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (14411.65): you. Before we move on\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (14424.49): from this, does anybody have a hand? Can we see this?\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (14447.99): So I know we have not made it to 0.4 yet, but I'd like to suggest 0.5. It is kind of linked to this conceptual learning capital, but in a way different. I think this is something that we're discussing with Martha. Sorry for this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Perfect timing. Perfect timing, sorry.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (14454.07): Sorry. It's my son's birthday. Happy\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (14455.89): birthday. What\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (14461.43): a low blow. Okay.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (14538.51): No, so I think it is with regards to transaction cost. Because there is a lot of like we don't get so much scale in the Amazon and all that you know like making an investment of 100,000 and 100 million it's the same work. So this is I think you know like we need to look at that in a transaction level, we need to look at that on a transaction level, we need to look at that on a fund level as well, because if you don't have such a big pool, like such a big portfolio, your funds may not be viable. And there are things with regards, you know, like funding structure, all the regulatory layers, like, it is expensive. And it's similar, I think that's why I was thinking about it now as we're talking about concessionary capital, because a lot of those compliance restrictions, like barriers with guarantees, is because of the capital requirements of the banks and how the banks are regulated and how they have to look into those assets. So I think it's similar to funds and other solutions as well. So maybe we can make the bang a little bit smaller, but we not really avoid it from the group that already wants to buy it.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (14538.81): All right,\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

I'll just pause for a minute before we do that. Oh, I get more paper. Okay, we're comfortable. All right. So the last point that we had come up with coming out of this is that I think there still is, even among the folks in this room who have experience engaging with the US government, an open question of, well, how do we get to the right person at the right time and how do these mechanisms work and so I do think that there is an element here of we have an opportunity I think to have conversations with folks like Anne and Ben who are representing mechanisms that are funded by the US government. There's also an opportunity here to have kind of concrete and direct discussions with members of the US government who've come to this conversation. But I did wanna highlight that even in this room, where I think we do have a higher than usual level of knowledge about how the US government works and what these various players would be to the table, there still are some questions about concretely, how do we get this done? How do we move from having a conversation and having an idea to actually accessing some type of financing or accessing technical assistance? And so I think the more that we can start to kind of identify where there are specific needs and gaps in these models presented or other things that you're thinking about, we can start to bring those conversations down to a level that gets at how might we engage on this point. So I don't know if others felt that that was a common theme, but it was something that we kind of heard coming through a few of the sessions this morning. So if anybody wants to comment on that, I'll open the floor. We're all just not going to comment on that, that's fine. All right, so it's it's 425 and I think we were trying to wrap you up by about 4.30 today just to give you guys your lives back. But were there any other kind of things that you took away from today that you would really like to raise to the group at the moment?\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (14676.81): Jose, I'm just gonna. Give you\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (14769.23): a microphone and let you keep talking. You're a wise woman. I'd just like to add 1 aspect that wasn't discussed at all, unfortunately, because we're so mindset in the US. When there is a government, you forget about private. But the power of supply chains is something extraordinary, and we have not discussed that. There's a lot of commercial flows between the US and Brazil, and that we can transform to bridge this for blended finance. We can have off-take agreements as basis for many of our discussions. And when you have that established, you're talking about, let's take an example, we have Cardio, an American company, an American trader. They already have plenty of activity in government business in Brazil for my economy. They can provide long-term of state agreements. And there is a threat established. There is a threat on dollars as well. And it's much easier to sell to an American investor. Cargill tend to sell Manioc. It's much easier. So I think that we need to establish a more strategic approach on how the U.S. Government and even the AmCham, the American Chamber, can help us connect with U.S. Trade Department to those supply chains. I think that we don't need more capital. We can risk, we can transform those capitals that are at fault between our countries. Now the microphone.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (14857.45): Would anybody like to respond or take that anywhere? Okay. All right. So let me wrap this up first by saying thank you. I recognize this was a long day. And we went through quite a lot of things in the 7 hours that we were together, 7 and a half hours we were together. We will start again tomorrow morning. And the twos, you will be up first tomorrow morning, so get a good night's sleep. And again, what we'll do tomorrow is continue the kind of project model discussions and the poster presentations, move into a plenary conversation where we can dig a little bit deeper into models of interest. Before you go, the facilitators are going to hand out some sticky dots. Oh, it's already done. The facilitators have handed out some sticky dots. Of the models on round 1 that are up on the walls. If you would please put 3 sticky dots on things you'd like to know more about. If you have 3 that you like equally, you can spread them out. If you have 1 model where you're super invested in hearing more about that model, go ahead and put all 3 on 1 sheet. It's really up to you how you like to do it. And again, we'll start to spend a little more time digging into 3 of those models as model models tomorrow, and have a conversation from there, and then in the afternoon, we will be doing some of the structured networking.\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (14858.91): So hopefully we'll see you all of\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (14891.21): you tomorrow, or the few who don't need to leave. But we thank you very much for your time. And again, if you are 1 and you would like to fill out an ID card so that we can make sure that we have a kind of a ability to follow your model back up to the appropriate folks in the US government please fill that out before you leave and make sure that your name your organization is on both the ADIP card and the poster. That was a lot of 1 very long 1 on the side of the soil. Thank you very much.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (14937.79): Thank you. Just to reiterate, the little sticky dots are your votes. You can trade your votes, don't sell them, no selling of votes, but you can put all your votes on 1 of the posters, and you can also put it at a specific place on the poster where you like, that's up to you, or you can spread them around. And what we want to do is kind of use that as a way of reading what you're more interested in as a group diving into tomorrow. So thank you, thank you, Reed, for leading that final discussion. Thank you all for your comments and your energy today. Wonderful work on the posters. We're looking forward to seeing the next 2 rounds tomorrow. Have a wonderful evening and we'll see you tomorrow. Thank you everybody. Applause\\n\\nVideo Title: 02_Amazon Investor Coalition_Ricardo Politi\\n[Speaker:0] (15436.76): Okay, so I'll present to them, right? Okay, okay, forget about the camera, okay, okay. This camera's not here. Okay, perfect. Okay, guys, so this is the Amazon Investor Coalition platform, what was the idea? When we created it, we created it within a group called Nexus, Nexus is 6,000 members, 70 countries, about $750 billion in aggregated net worth. So basically, we connect wealthy families, pools of wealth, circles of capital around the world into investing, donating, or buying corporate procurement contracts to projects that follows the SDGs. The Amazon Investor Coalition basically started as a way to bring Spectrum like a part of those investors and donors to also look at the Amazon rainforest as 1 of the nature-based solution to bring climate stability. We did that about 3 years ago. We focused in the beginning with the investors, and now we are working with the donation philanthropic capital and also on design mode for the corporate procurement buyer side of things. But we think that the secret sauce here is the blended finance. So really the strategy is that we can blend those 3 constituencies, which is philanthropic capital, for-profit impact investments, and corporations, as a way to de-risk the investment from the investor and also signal demand from the corporation which helps them to leverage. So we feel that bringing those 3 constituencies that seldom works together is the best way to unlock capital for such a high risk return ratio for projects in the Amazon bioeconomy. In the past 12 months, we've been working with investments. And I'll bring 2 real business cases, which actually happens to be here. So for the investor side, we did 2 things. We did demo days, pitch sessions to present deals and we did one-on-one matchmakings. On the demo days 1 of the projects that we ended up presenting from 200 finalists and then 15 short ones 1 of them is Courageous Land from Philip Couders who is here and 1 of the people watching those speeches was Leah from Incofin who is here as well. They connected and about a month ago she was in actually in Roraima as part of the due diligence really checking the project with boots on the ground so this is the kind of things that it's happening from those interactions. Also to the matchmaking, we connected Mombex. So yesterday, Dan was here. He's not here today. He's already back, taking a flight back to the US. But we connected Mombex, Peter, the CEO with AXA, the French insurance company, which led to a 50 million dollars investments into the company for their project. So that's what we have been doing. We recently launched what we call the small grants facility with the idea of trying to bring more donation to grassroots projects and also to blended finance instruments. So we received 166 projects submissions this week. We closed 2 days ago. Now we need to review them and try to find the 3 finalists and then we will upstream to our donor base. And we just recently got someone from the team, new on the team, which is the former CIO, the global CIO for Mars, who is now helping us to develop what we call the partnership development program, which is basically trying to bring more companies, you know, big food and beverage, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals to buy from the bioeconomy, the Amazon bioeconomy value chains. So that's basically what we do. The whole idea is like down the road, we can really bring those 3 together into innovative sustainable finance mechanisms and instruments because that's the best way we feel we can unlock capital from global north, pools of capital, sources of wealth, into projects in the global south. So I think that's basically what we do. Comments, reactions, criticisms. So in terms of the coalition, how do you kind of secure your resources? Our own resources? Yeah. So that's the most challenging part because normally it lacks capital for the intermediaries or the dynamisers because donors want to give straight to the project, so it's challenging. We were born with a grant from the UK government, which is weird because we are an American organization, 501c3 nonprofit organization, but we had to rely on the UK government partnership forest program to enable us to get out of the paper. And now we are like in between grants. We are we have a we are in a tough situation because we don't have a business model, right? We don't have a sustainable revenue stream where we can keep keep that we are trying out some like membership models like who knows we don't want to charge donors and investors because we don't want to lose them, you know. So the best way is to, so yes, that's the most challenging. And we are also a part of 1 of the USAID grant proposal that is out there. Fingers crossed, you know, like Alex is our ally, you know, Alex is the 1, our liaison helping to put this together and hopefully Mark is taking forward. So hopefully it'll work out. Let's see. But it's challenging times for us, even though we have a great... And your pipeline, How do you develop pipeline projects or find projects that are interesting? Perfect. So in the first year we used Funda\\u00e7\\u00e3o Certi as 1 of the implementing partners. So they have a program called Jornada Amaz\\u00f4nia and they have 3 kinds of acceleration, like a pre-acceleration, acceleration and a post-acceleration. I mean 3 stages where they help. So they help us to put that open call and bring the projects in. You know, the pipeline is not that huge. At the end of the day, it's just like a few projects that stands out. So now we are trying to also develop something different. And this would be probably with IDB, which is trying to also assist the entrepreneurial side of things. You know, it's not only educating investors on how to invest in the Amazon, which we've been doing the past 36 months, but how can we help those, that last mile in getting the company's investment ready, you know, getting that last mile knowledge so they can present to an AXA or to a Sequoia or any other like big VC fund and they will understand because Momvac is like former technology guys. It's my background. I come from the VC and the FinTech space. So, you know, there are Silicon Valley guys, of course, they look, they say, wow, they are good entrepreneurs. If they are doing tech-based or nature-based, I don't care. I think it's a good team. Sometimes when I bring projects that comes from the region, the Investors say, oh, I don't believe that community-led project will have the skill set to take that project. That's terrible. We want to make sure the project gets to where it should be, but it lacks knowledge. The ecosystem, the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the Amazon is not well developed. More knowledge, more capacity building, more workshops, mentorships, who knows? We are trying, how can we accelerate the learning curve there? So, yeah, good point. You considered, I would say I wouldn't want to charge the top, the donors, the investors, but I mean, consider charging your pipeline, the mom backs of the world. So that would be the best. Can you imagine like bringing 250 million reais, 50 million dollars and not getting a penny out of it? In the for profit world or the 2.5, like big corps, such as my fintech in my former life, we can charge success fees, placement agent fees, a transactional fee. On the non-profit world, it is a little challenging. I cannot even say that I really do like demo days. We do like, we showcase and we don't do deal making, we match make. So even the terminology, it's sometimes tough. So it's because the regulatory. Yes. So yeah. Are you doing any vetting of your pipeline opportunities? We do. We like to say we curate the pipeline because there is a lot of liability when you start doing some kind of due diligence or juizo de valor, how do you say juizo de valor in English? Value judgment, when I'm saying like oh I think this is a good deal. Sounds better in Portuguese. I know, I know. So our curation is objective because if something happens I don't want to be liable in the future, you know, so. Alright, done. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you very much. You guys, if you could come inside. Let's get back to work.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

I'm the co-founder of Capital for Climate, and I'm here with members of the Brazil team, as well here at this workshop with Marina Cancelo and Viviani Behar. If you go back 2 years, the nature-based solution investment space was a very fragmented ecosystem. Many different players, but not connected as a sector or industry, if you will. Capital for Climate came in recognition of this because we are an NBS sectoral catalytic engine and a sectoral accelerator if you will and I will explain what that means. But what we came in 2021 with the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to see what was needed to really mobilize capital at greater scale and with greater speed to nature-based solutions. And came up, did some research with the community, 60 interviews across the space and what emerged from all of that was an interest on the part of the community to create a collaborative, the Nature-Based Solution Investment Collaborative. The strategy is essentially to knit together the risk capital stack that is here in Brazil and sophisticated, but was not connected to 1 another. And that's across from catalytic capital to private equity, real assets, venture, et cetera. So we start with regional investors that are focused on nature-based solution, many of whom were here at the workshop. JGP, VRT, Santander, etc. And we then looked at the pipeline of opportunities, And we've been mapping the entire pipeline of opportunities with a focus on those nature-based solutions that both research, the academic research, and the community have said have the greatest potential to scale by 2030. And there are 5 different sectors from agroforestry, restoring degraded pasture land, regenerative ag, sustainable livestock management, ecosystem restoration. We have organized that community and we have a team here that's researching and sourcing the pipeline of opportunity currently at 160 funds and vehicles enterprises and project developers and they are all going on to our digital platform. I will get to that in a moment. This whole ecosystem, along with a number of critical stakeholder organizations, including governments and NGOs and others, are part of the system. And the critical piece here is to connect global capital to this local opportunity pipeline. You've got big global capital, trillions of AOM that have nature mandates and they need to know how to plug into and how to land in Brazil and find the best opportunities and do that most efficiently. And so that's also what we are very critically here to make happen. So how are we structured? We basically are guiding capital to the nature-based sector through our understanding of what solutions are working, who's working in them, and who are the players across the entire risk capital stack. We are organizing the pipeline, as I just said. We have 160 deals, funds, project developers, and enterprises at well over 750 million of raises going on. That 750 were just the people that were presented in our first roadshow in September, where we're attracting international capital. We had 64 attendees from international investment organizations, including the DFC, looking at 11 deals that were showcased over a two-hour virtual webinar. As I said those roadshows are continuing. We have 3 more lined up landing in an in-person roadshow. They were done in partnership with a number of entities, investor networks that are already working in the space. For example, the US State Department's Forest Investor Club at WBCSD, the UK Sustainable Markets Initiative, Nature Natural Capital Investment Alliance, and 15 different groups worldwide that are looking to drive capital to nature. And then finally there is the need to curate and link and groom this pipeline so that there is more absorptive capacity within the sector itself for the capital to actually make a difference because that is critical and 1 of the critical pieces of that is for example creating a blended capital or catalytic capital instrument that could help source many of the catalytic capital requirements of the players in this space, whether they're funds or developers or enterprises, offtake, growing offtake capability and supply chain, MRV capability, a number of these overcoming the barriers to scaling these enterprises. All of this is knitted together and supported through a digital platform we call the nbs.capitalforclimate.com. It has a whole body of work around Brazil in particular and we are expanding and to a global reach currently upon our initial. And on this digital platform are the deals are Are that is the knowledge the intelligence that tells the investment theses on all of these? Projects and Solutions the community that exists the ecosystem of players and the whole knowledge and resource community. All of this is designed to achieve the goal of mobilizing $5 billion in capital to nature-based solutions by BLEM, by COP30, and all of that to the resources, the enterprises that can scale to millions of hectares by 2030, which is what we know must happen in order to reverse the deforestation and the potential negative tipping point of the Amazon and all of the habitats here in Brazil. Save the Brazil nature, save the planet, achieve 70% of Brazil's NDC of decarbonization goals through nature-based solutions, which is the most efficient way and most mission-critical way to achieve the net 0 goals of Brazil. Thank you.\\n\\nVideo Title: 04_Capital for Cllimate_Deborah Stern_2\\n[Speaker:0] (15955.49): Okay, so there are currently 12 members of the collaborative. These are the founding members, Santander and the Rockefeller Foundation have recently joined and we're expanding. We intend to approximately double that within the coming months. And just to give you a sense, we launched a really successful summit back in April. We'll be doing another 1 in the new year. And as well as the roadshows that I mentioned earlier, we have 1 coming up on November 14th, another 1 on January, I think, 23rd, and then we'll do an in-person roadshow in association with our next summit. It was a very interactive summit that really galvanized the community and really turned what was a fragmented ecosystem into a formative early stage sector, which is our whole aim.\\n\\nVideo Title: 05_Clarmondial_Fred Werneck\\n[Speaker:0] (16184.68): Hi, this is Fred Wernick, co-founder of Clara Mondial. I'm here today to present the business case, which is a USAID program, and the Biosphere Integrity Fund, which is going to be 1 of the outcomes of the business case. Clara Mondial, we created it more than 10 years ago, in 2010 actually, to mobilize capital for the sustainable management of natural resources. That meant slightly different things over the years but more and more it's about agriculture and landscapes. So how does agriculture supply chains relate to the surrounding landscapes and how can we have that under sustainable practices? Today we have a bit of a conflict between the farmers, the supply chain and the natural environment, the landscape that surrounds it. And through that I think nature has been calling us, like we have the planetary boundaries, we are like beyond the limits, the situation is really bad. So this is where we have to see this type of agriculture activity, it has certain externalities and you have to find a way to bring those externalities into the model. This is tricky because bringing them into the model, we are adding costs. And you're adding costs on supply chains, on companies that don't have so much margin to deal with it. Because, you know, like trade, there's the whole agriculture production, like with climate change, with how the global economy has developed. It's a rather struggling business model, like agriculture is more and more difficult to do because of those changes. And we have to find a way to bring those externalities while underlying the business case, like what is the case for those companies. 1 thing that we do, we have in the business case consortium, Rainforest Alliance, Conservation International, working with the landscape action plan, making that assessment and defining the interventions. Besides that, we also have CDP, raising awareness and calling for transparency and reporting on those actions. And our case, Clare Montreal, what we bring is the financial layer. What does that mean? Well, I tried to draw it here. We see finance, it's a time machine, like it's a magic. Like we go into the future, we get some future cash flow, and you bring it back to present. What do we do with it? Well, we have to finance the transition to sustainable practices. Some money is there, because as I mentioned, when you bring in those externalities, some of that creates better margin. Like it helps the companies to improve and they're willing to pay for it. But in other cases, there are markets that do not exist yet. We have to help them with payment for environmental services with biodiversity, water rights. There are many things that today they don't have a price, that cash flow does not exist. So we have to find a way to bring everyone together and use that to create those markets, like to build that bridge so that, you know, because that money has to be there in the future, otherwise what would our time machine find? So it has to be there. So we have to build that, those sustainable business models. We have to help those companies get there so that we have a sustainable landscape approach within the planetary boundaries. So that's what we're building, the Biosphere Integrity Fund, long-term debt, in order to support that transition. So thanks a lot to USAID for the support. Thanks to you, we are here and you can discuss that. Thank you. Thank you. Energy.\\n\\nVideo Title: 06_Conexsus_Marcelo Cwerner\\n[Speaker:0] (16313.53): Hello, my name is Marcelo Sverner. I'm Innovative Finance Leader at Connexus and Connexus' work is to strengthen community business, rural and forest business that are protecting the environment and also enabling livelihood conditions for vulnerable communities in the Amazon and other biomes of Brazil. We have developed a finance platform whereby we develop different financing products to different stage business being then cooperatives, associations most of the times, but also private companies that are within the ecosystems of communities, being buyers of their production or offering some type of impact service to them. And We finance them basically with 3 different products. 1 is directed to very early stages. The other 1 is called microfinancing. And the other, it's with capital markets vehicles that we seek investors to contribute in a blended finance strategy where we look for resources to de-risk their investment. And I think that the US government could be catalytic to unlock financing even further to community business through maybe guarantees and giving their strength in capital to unlock capital from commercial investors and also being able to guarantee the projects that are longer term and that sometimes can have profitability on the long term. So this is what I expect and hope that the US government can come and help us out in this mission of financing the community businesses.\\n\\nVideo Title: 07_Courageous Land_Philip Kauders\\n[Speaker:0] (16472.81): Hi everyone, I'm Philip Couders from Courageous Land. The issue that we're trying to tackle here is that monocultures and degraded pasture lands with cattle are huge emitters of CO2, They're degrading the biodiversity in the region, and they do not provide income opportunities for local communities. And our solution to help solve this is a relatively elegant and simple 1 that solves a lot of problems simultaneously. It's essentially restoring and reforesting these degraded lands by planting biodiverse organic agroforestry systems at scale that can produce not only carbon credits from the sequestering of CO2, but also high amounts of income from the crops that you can grow there, increase biodiversity, increase income generation for the local families, create sustainable value chains and help corporates decarbonize their value chains, increase conservation as a condition for selling the carbon in the crops from the agroforestry system, so helping enrich the remaining forests, create health for the consumers by providing organic foods that are free of agro toxins, and helping with climate change adaptation in addition to the climate change mitigation as agroforestry tends to be an excellent adaptation method for what's coming next. What we do is we build out these agroforestry systems on proprietary and partner lands. Right now we have 3 hubs in Brazil, in the Amazon and Joraima, in Bahia, and then also in the southeast of Brazil. In addition to these agroforestry systems, we have processing facilities and we manage the carbon and the sales channels for the hub on our own land and on partner land. And in order to do this at scale in a very professionalized way, we've built out an agroforestry intelligence platform that sits above everything that our own projects and also other projects can plug into for agroforestry planning, financing, management, and carbon slash crop sales from these agroforestry projects. And support from the US government can come in a number of different forms. I think financing the agroforestry projects at the project level or helping guarantee that would potentially be an avenue through DFC. And I think USAID would be an excellent partner at the company level where we're developing projects and the overall agroforestry platform in order to help unlock grant financing or introduce us to equity financiers that can help us advance this company and this mission. Thank you very much.\\n\\nVideo Title: 08_Fundo Vale_Helio Laubenheimer\\n[Speaker:0] (16512.49): Hello everyone, I'm Helio from Fundo Vale. We'll briefly explain the model that we've been working on since 2019. Very briefly, Vale, which is a mining company, has established in 2019 a goal in order to recover 100 million dollars.\\n\\nVideo Title: 09_Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance_Phillipe Ka\\u0308fer\\n[Speaker:0] (16769.54): Let's go. Just talk to me a little bit. 1, 2. Hello, how are you? Cool, you're on audio. Let's go in 3, 2. Hi everyone. So, my name is Filipe Keifer. I work for the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance from Climate Policy Initiative. And our basic idea is how to accelerate financial structures. So what we have new here is that this year will be we have just launched a new stream that we are accelerating financial structures to mobilize private capital into forests with high integrity. And the reason about this is that everyone knows about the importance of the forests in general that we have, but at the same time we're not paying enough attention to the levels of integrity that a forest has. So find ways to monetize these places could be very recognition for the local communities and indigenous peoples who are like in many places the guardians of these forests and at the same time these places are carbon sinks and biodiversity hubs. So the question is everyone knows that this is very important but at the same time they need money and how to get this money. So the basic idea here is a fiction that we are imagining some missions in this sense, in which it will consider different types of revenue streams. And here, there is a blender because we see as this should come together so a productive stream on non-timber forest products for example seeds and nuts and in the case of like seeds we can also think about like having initiatives relate to restoration practices in buffer zones for example and then we can put money inside these communities as well. Another way is payment for ecosystem services and biodiversity credits, but here is a little more exercise that we need to do. So for example if there is like a company here and that needs like clean water for their activity, it may be interested on monetizing these people to protect the area. So we need to find this, where is the financial element within these industries. So and finally, community-based ecotourism. So this is how can we manage tourism in these regions without being harmful for the macro region for the preservation. So we want we need to like have all do this together. So and the fund here could be a debt, but the idea of the fund is to give capital to SMEs that will have relationship with this revenue streams that I just discussed and the community will produce that we can like verticalize the production streams and this will also like give like impact to results. So we work with partnerships for the goal, so we should have like industry, we should have NGOs to relate to the IPLCs and get their consent, and of course the private capital to be invested here. So the exciting part is that like nobody is looking to a very important thing so we are happy to start like this with like more dedicated passion and I think what we could like USA government could help us on this is first is like technical assistance and you know making constant conversations about like biodiversity markets and how can we implement ways to replace the concessionality of the capital to make something that will be more in private interest. So yes, basically, thank you.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

We've been investing in financial inclusion and agri-food value chains for the last 20 years. And we saw an opportunity to start or to develop a regional fund in Latin America for the 6 Amazonian countries with priorities for Brazil, Colombia and Peru. And this is our model. So it's a model based on a blended structure of these 3 components, metting in depth, technical assistance and effects risk mitigation structure. The idea of the fund is to build climate resilience through value chains. So taking our experience in smallholder farmers, in investing in smallholder farmers in agri-food systems, we saw an opportunity to take it over these or to expand our experience to other crops and other sectors including agroforestry, biochemicals, or different processes in bioeconomy, and bioenergy. So with Mezzanine Debt, we think this is 1 of the innovative parts of the fund, because there's the possibility to provide enough patient capital, enough time and flexibility in cash flows for the companies that we're investing in, but not with the need to provide or to give up control over their companies. And we also see that for example in Peru, Colombia, Brazil, in countries that are with the exception of Brazil, the capital markets are not that sophisticated. So we saw that senior, like mezzanine debt was a good option for having this patient capital with the right structure and enough like, yeah, and appealing for existing projects. Technical assistance, also to build capacities and go together with the companies in the process of growth. We don't want to invest and wait until year 10 to get out. We want to build value with the company through technical assistance and also de-risk the projects and make them successful. And the last 1 is, as we have 6 countries in this project, we see the need for vehicles that allow us to mitigate FX risk, especially in Colombia and Brazil, in which we think there's a need to set up local vehicles for feeders that could even fundraise locally, but also invest in local currency, because We don't have hedges for 7 or 8 years in the market for these currencies. And investees or companies really need to access funding in local currency. We invest in growth. So we are not VC investors. We're investors in proven models that can be escalated with this type of financing. And we want to make this happen to build climate resilience for the people and to make sure that biodiversity in this region is protected. So we see CO2 and biodiversity credits as a plus for the model, not as the only source of revenue, but as a plus to make them feasible projects and also to have an additional source of revenue for the communities and the people in the region. We target 100 million dollars fund with 20 to 30 investees so ticket sizes around 5 million And we also see the need for catalytic capital at the fund level, because we know agro well, and we know that it's difficult. So we see that there's a need for covering part of the credit risk through a first loss and or a guarantee. And this is it. Thank you.\\n\\nVideo Title: 11_JGP Asset Management_Jose Pugas\\n[Speaker:0] (17244.38): At JGP Asset Management, we developed a new business model for aquifers for operation. There is space at not only land acquisition, but much more on apply cooperation between the different landowners under a professional structure that we call an special purpose vehicle in which have aqua forestry operators dealing with land leases or operating through agricultural partnerships with smallholders in some areas in Brazil, dedicating themselves to produce non-timber forest products. We selected 9 non-timber forest products that are dedicated for exporting, So no problem for our loans to be dollar-based. We have a natural hatch operating on that. To make the capital market understand that business model that we are applying, we developed a FITIC FIAGRO. It's a revolving credit facility established under Brazilian jurisdiction, well, it's very well known by the Brazilian investors, is registered at the stock exchange, and makes much more credible. The model to be applied is a planted finance that is structured up to mechanisms, in which we have 3 different branches, the mezzanine, the junior, and the senior. What is the twist for that? What is innovative about that? Not just about the business model, in which we can include the smallholder in agroforestry, but mostly on the blended finance, the junior trench is not composed by, not constituted by TFI's or MTB's or philanthropies. They are constituted by corporate venture philanthropy. So when someone is underwriting the super-generative trends, the junior trends specifically, the return is not on money, not in kind. The return is in carbon credit. So it helps us as a first law to risk the whole operation. The mezzanine will be operating as concessional capital. You have less participation of the carbon credits and a small financial return. And the senior will be the catalytic for everyone. We are multiplying the subordinated trench, and the subordination will be only 30% of the total operation. But it doesn't mean that we are starting with 30%. We have to start much more, much more aggressive on subordination. That's why we developed different calls for capital during the 2 years of the project. The first call for capital has a larger subordination and the other ones will be even smaller, smaller, smaller than when we have an average of 30% of subordination at the end of the life cycle of this fund. The fund is a 12 years fund for amortizing with 24 months grace period, what allows us the cash flow to be adapted to the reality of the production. So it's 24 months to 36 months of grace period depending on the non-timber forest project to be established. For us at JGP, considering what the US government could help us, Mostly connecting supply chains, what is essential to make this project to have the proper offtake agreements, but also credit guarantees. We are talking about the risk enough to operations much better to have the guarantees to the risk and improve the perception of risk by the investor than cheap capital. It's not what we want to afford right now, it's we welcome, but the credit is, will be much more. Thank you.\\n\\nVideo Title: 12_MOV Investimentos_Paulo Bellotti\\n[Speaker:0] (17370.85): Hello, I'm Paulo Belotti from Movi Investimentos. Movi is an impact investing fund manager in Brazil and we are developing this model. It's a fund to invest in the Amazon. The vision is that the forest has to be equal to high levels of human development. That's the only way that the forest will continue to stand, it will regenerate and be conserved. So we already raised 70 million from 26 investors. We are trying to reach 140 million reais. In this fund, we'll look for 2,000 companies, opportunities, we already look at 550. We invest in 8, in 4 areas. Restoration of degraded land, integrated beef production, environmental services and non-timber products and education, coding and reduction of dropouts in universities and technical schools in the Amazon. These 8 companies will help them grow. When they grow, they will attract more good capital and influence public policy so the Amazonas can stand and generate high levels of human development for the people in the region. We are targeting for our investors 3 times, 25% per year. With these results, we are gonna raise more capital and do this again. What is exciting, we believe it's a systemic change. We are helping or being a small part to develop in developing a new model for the region and how the US government can help us. It can help us mobilizing that capital, it can help us with networking, finding opportunities, and finding human capital, and it can help us attracting capital at the level of the companies.\\n\\nVideo Title: 13_Produzindo Certo_Thiago Brazil\\n[Speaker:0] (17583.50): I'm Thiago Brasil from Produzindo Certo. Produzindo Certo is implementing part of a green bond operation that we created here in Brazil for helping producers to assess capital markets in order to achieve more favorable terms in raising money. So we help producers through technical assistance, engagement and social environmental assessment. We help them through a securization process and we believe that US government can help us by providing insurance to lower the final cost of capital of this operation probably as an investor as well through concessional capital and also obviously through grants to help cost the technical assistance and all the engagement process. What is exciting about this operation and that is a way to finance individual producers, not companies, enterprises or groups, and make them engage with sustainable practice, low carbon emissions and 0 deforestation production. So the most exciting of this operation is that we can actually finance individual producers that is really hard. So basically the most exciting of this operation is that we can provide capital to producers that actually care about sustainable production here in Brazil, and we can actually make it happen. So just an example, that is an operation that we actually engaged for 1 year already and almost like 7 to 8 to 10 percent of the capital mobilized were reverted to adequacies in terms of sustainable production. So we understand that to escalate the transformation that we aim to do here in the field, US government can help us by providing grants to finance the technical assistment that is provided by our team or any other team in the field. We also understand that it can offer guarantees such as an insurance for the total amount of the debt of the operation, lowering the final cost of the interest for the producer, and actually also becoming an investor in that operation through concessional capital. It's a really flexible operation that we created here. It can aim almost all type of cultures. So we can work that for cotton, for corn, for cattle, for soy and other types obviously. And through all types and sizes of producers. It obviously has a gain of scale here in terms of costs and in terms of the interest rate. 1 of the major problems in this operation to escalate it is the high cost of capital that comes with commercial interest rates and adding technical assistance and more constraints regarding diversification and adequacies that are required in the process. So we understand that US government can help us by providing grants that obviously can cost this technical assistance and engaging process with the producer. We understand also that it can provide insurance to help us lowering the final cost of the operation and concessional capital so it can actually lower the interest rate and make a blended financing process that can help us gather more money in the market with commercial rates and bring down the total cost of the operation.\\n\\nVideo Title: 14_ProNatura International - Shared Value Platform_Marcelo de Andrade\\n[Speaker:0] (17750.49): Well, Pronatura Internacional is a share value platform. We are a non-profit development agency called Pronatura Internacional, 38 years old. We developed a system and a methodology and a few years ago we partnered with the IFC and we made it into the share value platforms, which have much larger scope. We have an operational side and a financial side. And what it does, it goes into regions, It takes a landscape approach, large region, and identify the value chains that are most adequate, visibility studies, and the visible ones become business plans. With the business plans, the robust business plans, with a very thick risk analysis chapter, we go into the market and raise blended finance to inject in the value chains. There's a portion, 10 to 20 percent of non-profit venture philanthropy that de-risks the portfolio, and then there is a large portion of debt, usually, ideally, a bond structure or a smaller other debt structure. And the equity side is the projected carbon that will be generated by those projects over a 30-year period. We inject that capital in, and it works. So there's 2 phases. The preparatory phase, which is everything that I told you about, until The moment we get commitment to investors. And the second phase is the investment, deployment phase. The preparatory phase is bankrolled by venture philanthropy capital, and it's a revolving evergreen facility. Once you spend 2 to 3 to 5000000 dollars maximum to create all everything that I described business plans and pipelines and venture and then you raise the capital all the way to the time you raise the capital this is preparatory phase and then the first drawdown is the is you ask for the fund the commitment that the committed investors to pay back your structure fee, the $5 million you used to get there. And that's a little bit remunerated, and then you start a new cycle to generate more investment opportunities. And this is all based on the bottom of the pyramid on communities living in the middle of Amazonia that instead of burning and slashing and eating up the natural resources they have a they grow a healthy economy perennial without destroying nature as a matter of fact enhancing it 2 and a half minutes, ok? Is it over? It's over, that's it Thank you Obrigado.\\nVideo Title: 15_Re.green_Ana Luiza Squadri-002\\n[Speaker:0] (18225.58): Welcome to Rio Green. Our business model is that we restore degraded cattle farming, unproductive cattle farming farms. And we do it by getting to a five-star restoration by the end of it. And why the five-star is very important. First, because then you can ensure that all the ecological processes have been restored. So if in 150 years from now we have a fire into that land it will restore itself just as a primary forest does. And we're doing that by having 60 different types of restoration models. We're kind of the doctors or Sherlock Holmes of the land. So we make an assessment and diagnosis of that area, understand all the natural potential for regeneration and we plant the trees so we can have a forest that is designed to be perpetual and that is designed also to maximize for carbon capture. 1 of our superpowers is that we design and we choose the locations so we can maximize not only for soil and humidity but also for the biodiversity that we enhance. So our chief scientist officer has an article in Nature in which he describes that if you have a restoration that is in which the location is chosen by chance and another 1 which is maximized for restoration you tend to capture 8 to 10 times more carbon into that area. So as we choose the areas that are the best, not only for the carbon capture, but also for all the co-benefits that we generate, we're able to have a great forest by the end of it and also you're very cost effective. So the first quality that we want to have is the integrity of the credits that we create but also the scale in which we aim to do it and by having scale we can be effective in terms of costs but also we have a greater impact. You can bring the pumas and the birds back because we have a greater forest into the areas that we own and by owning it I say that we acquire land right now. We see this as a sunk cost. We do not have any returns over the areas, over the appreciation of the land that we acquire, but we do it because we see this as the most effective way to have land and to restore it right now, but we are also building in development a model in which we can have partners and have a greater scale with less money. So the idea here is that we restore land. Currently, we have potential clients who are willing to prepay for those credits and have a off-take contract. So we de-risk the commercial part of the carbon credits and we have a greater rate of return by receiving prepayments in terms of it. Also, what is very important into our model is that we are able to restore more degraded land by having additional revenue of sustainable timber to up to 30% of the areas that we acquire. And that's important first, because as we look forward, as we are moving toward a more sustainable world, we'll face the need not only for more sustainable raw materials for constructions and everything else, but also we will face a problem as native 90% of the native Timber that we use Brazil comes from illegal sources. So we will probably face a supply crunch and our ideas to Supply that that native species timber with our business model. So what is very important to stress as well is that we do it only with native species. So the diversity part, we have over 100 species, up to 100 species into that part. In our timber we have 10 different species and we do that by mimicking the process that is very natural in nature, that is the succession of species. So by doing that, when we harvest 1 of those lines of timber, the forest is stronger afterwards. So then we can also restore areas that are more complex to restore, which is really great as well. So we have now 2 revenue streams. 1 of them is carbon credits. The second 1 is timber, but we have the potential to all the products and services that you can offer into forest. So we're studying agroforestry and everything else, not only as a revenue stream for us, but so we can have a greater bond with the community. Well, what is exciting, innovative about this? First, we've been doing excellent restorations in Brazil for a while now, but not in large scale. And by having large scale, we'll create income, we'll share that income, we'll create a greater impact, and it will be able to be very competitive in terms of VCUs, which is very important. Something that is very awesome as well is our scientific team. We are very detail-oriented and technological in terms of the proprietary knowledge that we have in terms of the intelligence behind this spatial location, as well as all the methods that we use. And how can you help us? Well, first, We are currently a capital intensive model and we have over 30,000 hectares of land that we have acquired, in which it's very important to say by the end of it will become national parks. And we need capital so we can expand. We had a series A which was a total of 85 million dollars, but Our idea is to scale not only through equity, but also through other capital opportunities, being financing loans, as well as our clients, because they're willing to prepay part of those credits. But 1 bottleneck that we face now is collateral or guarantees for getting those financing and those opportunities. So 1 great way to help us would be with a guarantee or an insurance. Most of our clients currently are US companies, US-based companies. So that would be very important for us to access that capital because we have capital that is willing to come to a green, but we face a great challenge by not having guarantees that we can give it to them. I guess that's it.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

Seyo Ventures is the investment advisor to the End Green Fund, a fund that is established in the Netherlands to promote and finance the establishment of the production of commodities which are free from deforestation. The business case that we have introduced to the group during this event from USAID and the USDFC was about the difficulties that we have in the process to establish this condition in our transactions. In the beginning we were, let's say, putting a lot of effort to do that, but so far, after a few years working in this space, we see now that this subject became something that is very keen by the stakeholders or the borrowers, the potential clients that we have to consider this type of financing linked to 0 deforestation. From the US government and the 8 agencies that are here, we expect the possibilities to provide first loss to certain transactions that in some cases we try to aggregate and bring more, let's say, small holders in a group and also provide funding, that funding that could support us in the development of this project that we have, not only in Brazil, but in any area that has pressure for deforestation coming from the production of commodities. Thank you very much. That's it.\\n\\nVideo Title: 17_Santander_Leo Fleck\\n[Speaker:0] (18559.59): Hi, I'm Leo Fleck. I'm the senior head of sustainable innovation at the Santander Bank in Brazil. We are 1 of the 3 largest banks in the country and we have committed ourselves 3 years ago to support the sustainable development in the Amazon through our financing. 1 of the innovations we have in the organization is the creation of an area dedicated to sustainable innovation, which I have led since January this year. Basically what we do is we try to put together structures and financial transactions that are more complex, and usually banks don't approve them because They take more risk, they require collaboration with external entities, they require seeking blended finance instruments. So that's why we were created. This year we have been able to announce a few of these highly innovative structures with a very clear impact thesis. 1 of them is this 1, is a fund focused on the Amazon B economy to support agroforestry systems and also non-timber forest product extraction. 1 of the key challenges to be able to support those cooperatives and startups in the Amazon is that many of them are not used to taking credit, so they don't have a track record of repayment of debt. This involves much higher risk for us to support them. For that reason, we need to blend our capital with philanthropic capital, with development banks' capital, which accept a higher level of risk to take the first shock, right? And often also accept an interest rate that is lower than the market rate, which is what we can offer. So that is where I believe the US government could provide significant support. So you can leverage the commercial capital that I can bring through concessional capital.\\n\\nVideo Title: 18_VERT_Martha de Sa\\u0301_1\\n[Speaker:0] (18691.04): I'm going to talk about the low carbon agriculture transition mechanism. It's a mechanism to finance the transition towards more sustainable agriculture in Brazil and the idea came out because we have 100 million hectares of degraded pasture land and Brazil can be a very relevant player on food security when we talk about population and growing demand for food and at the same time nature-based solutions and sustainable agriculture. So today we do have this huge amount of land that it's underproductive and it also contributes to further deforestation. So when we see what the farmers need to transition from their perspective, they lack knowledge, so technical assistance, access to long-term capital with grace periods which match their needs for the transition, and also sometimes they have a high opportunity cost and they're not willing to face this risk alone, So we really need to have a de-risking tool there. When we have all those 3 mechanisms together, we'll be able to finance the transition and then have this land, more productivity land, and also avoid deforestation. The partners that will be with us in this are the corporates. The corporates are on the ground, so they have access to the farmers and they are also an important de-risking credit enhancement as they have commercial relationships and they can monitor the farmers on the ground and we are doing this across 4 different verticals so the greater passion and sustainable livestock management integrated systems our agroforestry, and bioeconomy. This is the model.\\n\\nVideo Title: 19_VERT_Martha de Sa\\u0301_2\\n[Speaker:0] (18765.21): What's exciting and innovative about this We were being selected by the CPI lab this year because of the innovation and I think the innovation comes from this de-risking facility mainly and we are also talking about the blended finance structure and innovation also relates to capacity of scalability which is a huge challenge in those deals in Brazil. And how do I think the US government could help? Many possibilities. So being an investor in either the subordinated trench concessional capital or a senior investor helping us with hedging or partial guarantees and also on carbon credits, especially soil carbon which we think can be an important kicker and upside in the project.\\n\\nVideo Title: 20_Vox Capital_Gilberto Ribeiro_1\\n[Speaker:0] (18815.41): I'm Gilberto, a partner at Vox Capital. I'm here to present Vox Regae 15.3 Regenerative. This is a fund dedicated to purchase the graded land in the Brazilian Cerrado, a real assets fund, that will lease this land to a Brazilian cooperative to implement a model called ICLF-FAST. ICLF is a model of production associated with a better carbon balance, a better ecosystem service providence, and what we aim to do with this thesis is to prove that it's possible for you to increase food production while preventing further deforestation in Brazil. The Fund intends to sell this land at a premium once we recover the degraded pasture land to this new production model and then achieve higher prices on the land.\\n\\nVideo Title: 21_Vox Capital_Gilberto Ribeiro_2\\n[Speaker:0] (18850.59): This is an exciting and very innovative instrument in Brazil and the US government could involve by investing. The international fundraising of the fund will start in Q1 next year or by providing other sorts of finance for this mechanism. For 1 example, this is going to be a listed fund. For us, in order to start trading, we need a market maker or a stabilizer for the shares of the fund, so we can increase liquidity of the instrument, or other forms such as concessional capital for farmers and other forms of partnership.\\n\\nVideo Title: 22_WORKHSOP_DAY_2mp4\\n[Speaker:0] (18933.64): We're going to start in 2 minutes, 2 minutes. Or going to a nearby restaurant, we can have a refreshment. We'll have a moment where we'll have small groups get together and really identify what are the key takeaways that you have from the 2 days together, and specifically what you want the U.S. Government to do, to do ideas for them. And then we will break. There's a restaurant just a couple of blocks away we will go to and have a refreshment at the end of the day. We are going to ask that you think about who you want to meet with from the US government, whether it's the FDA. We will publish after lunch, on or before lunch, on the wall, those meetings in a spreadsheet. So Ria's a spreadsheet master, she will make that happen. Another thing we'd like to do is, Because it's very difficult for us to capture each 1 of your poster stories, what we'd like to do is we're going to set up sort\\n[Speaker:1] (18936.80): of a photo loop, but it's going to be a video loop.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (18963.14): And we want to get every 1 of you for 2 minutes, you'll come see me, and I'll have our video camera, and I'm just going to ask you a few questions or ask you to respond to a few questions and then just listen to you talk about your model, talk about the things that you'd like to see where perhaps the U.S. Government may be able to help your organization or you.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (18964.60): What is your model? What's exciting\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19004.48): or innovative about it? What do you think the US government could do to help you? Those will be the problems. So I know 2, and leave the other ones behind. Then you can take, there's a place here And you put your poster next to the feedback sheet over here 1 in the front here 1 in the front here, And there are 4 in the hallway. So we have 8 presentations. Again, you won't be able to see every presentation because there's only 4 rounds. But does everybody understand now how we want the poster presentations to work? 4 minutes to present, 4 minutes to get feedback. Write your feedback on this\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (19005.92): sticky note. Put it on\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19008.46): a little blank sheet. Yeah? And then we rotate.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (19011.20): Yes, sir? If you have like 1 minute,\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19014.12): and then you can decide where you want to go. Mark.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (19017.50): Can you show Mark? Yes. Are some of the posters on the poster in the right\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19019.20): or in the top? Yeah.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19027.42): I see. Are there any posters? Some of you can show us? Yeah. Yes. So, yes. And 4.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19027.94): Can you hear\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19029.84): me? Can you hear me?\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (19073.44): Let me see. Let me see.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19078.80): If you had a poster that was on 1 of the easels, it\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (19078.98): is outside.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19094.36): Easels it is outside. If you don't find your poster it is already outside on 1 of the easels. Do you need some tape? Yes, I do.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (19096.08): All right. So we've got a couple\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19122.20): of filters here. And we're going to have 1 over there, 1 over there, and then 4 outside. So that's a little spot. And then we're going to have 5.\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (19152.60): Yeah, other than Rick and Laurie.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19229.22): I'll make sure. Okay. We need to have audience at each 1 of the presentations, please. 2 people here. Can we have 2 people here? 2 people here. We have 2 people there. Okay, we're okay. There are presentations outside. Rick, lead by example if you could go outside. Okay, that's okay. You can be an audience outside, please. Okay, come on, let's move. Can you guys go outside if you don't find a place here? And if you see a bunch of people already at a station, move to another 1 if you can. I mean, I know you're gonna, you'll have 4 opportunities to see the 1 that you want to see. We're gonna start in 30 seconds. Make sure, Has everybody got an audience here? Okay. Okay. All right. Let's start the presentations. Go! Let's go.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19245.82): And\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19250.10): this is how the Buddha came together\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19253.14): and it's inspired by the neighbor\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19263.46): that was believed, like it's not a Brazilian story but it's believed to be the origin of the Neanderthals\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19342.28): Nuts and seeds for restoration in other parts, carbon credits and payments for persistent services, and eco-tourism. Because what we have as key to be blended, because if we consider only 1 of these, we will not have enough resources for that. Basically, Edea, the fund will be an equity fund of 20 years. It will be investing in SMEs that relates to these revenue streams around here. We thought about having 3 types of like investors and donors. Instead of concessional capital based on the conversation we had yesterday, maybe here is more like passion capital instead of like concessional because we're talking about equity and commercial will be like the biggest part but of course we need to force labor and jackal etc and very quickly spits out a scoring. Telling you very recently.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19346.28): We're bringing these, we're basically showcasing the deal flow,\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19356.54): the best of the best. And we have, we're guiding the capital, as I said, to the opportunities that\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19358.22): are based on what's available.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19376.72): Okay, the 4 minutes is up. Now transition to getting feedback.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19380.76): We're talking about TSC and ITAC, and actually the scale to millions\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19384.55): of hectares by 2040. So that's our North Star.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19390.34): More than our North Star is our South Star. OK, 1 thing.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (19391.06): In ITD, you guys\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (19399.78): are still involved, so be careful. Could be a mess, but anyway. But then now ISIS is there. All bets are off until they go, they get away.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19401.02): But we're just waiting for people\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (19404.48): to do that. Do you see these organizations?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19406.70): Do you get to see them? Absolutely.\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (19433.94): And that's 1 of the issues with our different activities around the world, but also with USC's other activities that are not part of CFDA. So trying to learn from them, figure out where our model's scalable, replicable. And for us, that's something that's really important. Is the model scalable? Is it replicable? Is it inclusive? Are you working with the communities on the ground? And is there additionality? That's a big 1 for us.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (19438.16): Well, that's an easy 1. Great. So that's OK. Well, let's\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (19441.32): continue our conversation. We started the conversation\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (19443.46): before, and maybe. Year 6,\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19460.00): I'll start a dividend yield. And it's going to be like 5% to 6% a year from the leases. The first year, the leases are paid, but they're quite small because we're subsidizing the productivity curve of\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19462.82): the farm. But by the second half of\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (19464.34): the year, you will have income, so\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19468.54): you can convert this fund into an income fund.\\n[Speaker:11] (19495.36): So thinking about the US dollar, I was thinking here, is there anything that a source of concessional capital guarantees could do to help with the liquidity? I never thought about that, but I'm just wondering if there could be a partner that could help some of the investors exit from the investment earlier. I don't know. I haven't heard about it.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19508.94): There is a project We need to evaluate and then send upstream to basically 30 donors. And also we are starting to develop the strategy. Are these donors or\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (19512.45): family offices that you mentioned on the call? Yes, exactly. Like young\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19530.36): people that are... Yes, yes. It's intergenerational. It's not only the next gen. But it started with the Maxis, but it expanded now. So it's not really a private foundation, we only work with private capital owners, so it's like corporations or family offices or private foundations or individual donors.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19538.80): OK, time is up for this round. Time is up. Time is up.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19563.42): The main source is unlocking private capital. That's where we feel we should focus. So now working with the grants and donation and also developing the strategy for the corporations. How we're going to do this? We have the former global CIO for Mars who is helping us to develop this program, which we call the Partnership Development Program. The whole idea is understanding more than\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19566.88): the capacity, the quantity, the quality Time is up.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19574.00): Of a few products and species from the Amazon by the economy, understanding the value chain.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

Exactly, because the GDP is really disrupting the divorce.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19661.75): It really disrupts the divorce.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (19667.24): So, she decided to leave. And we\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19671.20): are working in a very extreme aspect of it. So,\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (19673.52): for the community, we need to do\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19676.86): a lot of work. We should be long-term. No,\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (19677.76): No, no,\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19701.20): no. It's a decision-making tool for now. Again, now we've said we wanted to make a difference and we changed the status quo and initiated a process whereby there will be lending activity in the Chaco and then we'll transfer ownership to the sustainable finance front table and they'll be able to expand on the product if and when you see\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (19703.44): fit. It would\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19709.96): be interesting to eventually then monitor, take another snapshot a few years later and then you could compare and\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19711.22): you could deduct some sort\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19713.10): of impact on the data.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19715.24): That's an interesting suggestion. We have to\\n\\n[Speaker:13] (19718.00): see how. 2 minutes for feedbacks. Because we\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19752.92): have tens of database, some of them being updated online, so it's easy to update some of the data that goes into our tool. Other, as I said, are not publicly available. We are like an additional part of the sub-key of Microsoft. Here is the partnerships from those who have been design geos, who have been industry, who have been like a sub-key player.\\n\\n[Speaker:13] (19769.46): 1 minute. Feedback. It's your last chance.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19772.86): And this place will help create new possibilities\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (19775.82): to create innovative solutions for the people\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19807.62): of this country. This was not smoothed by the media, for which SMEs were not allowed to create directly, same thing as the GMC, and we learned to do X, but we don't know what we learned to do. So what we were asking those banks in the form of a government program was not to use our funds to finance any single channel. So every time we had a conversation with people who said, give me this channel, it was at the outset, no,\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (19811.38): we don't do that. Well, Bruno Guerra is working\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19818.58): to hire a giant on RAM on this. He's a senior man, but he's also a person of faith.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19850.10): Part of our mission is to find a way to get the knowledge of the world.\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (19851.86): So, I mean, definitely, we're talking\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19861.66): to the investors. I guess, steps to make sure that we're doing what it means that we don't have to do the blacklist.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19868.92): I guess, if there's a question on Twitter, just do it, I'll have you like an answer or that.\\n\\n[Speaker:13] (19871.74): All right. 4 minutes for feedbacks, please.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (19893.98): I just realized I'm recording my conversation. Feedbacks. I think it makes sense to sit down and chat.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (19894.10): All\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (19960.74): right. So thank you all very much. I hope everybody's awake now and your coffee has kicked in. Everybody should have a little slip of paper with 3 sticky dots on it. Does everybody have a sticky paper? So we're gonna take a break in a minute, but prior to taking the break, we'd ask you to go around, remember, and we're gonna vote with our dots on the models or projects that you would like to hear more about in our panel discussion. So you can put all 3 of your dots on 1 poster if you're really into that poster. You can spread them out around posters if you'd like. However you'd like to kind of signal your interest, go ahead and do that now, and then you can move to having some coffee, taking a break, etc. While you're on break, if there are specific meetings you'd like to request with the US government, please come see me and I will add you to the schedule. Okay? Thank you very much. And we need to be back in 15 minutes, please.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20115.86): Okay, everybody, we're going to start the last round of poster presentations in 1 minute, 1 minute. If you haven't yet voted with your dots, please do so. All of Round 2 are here in this corner. I repeat, if you have not voted yet, with your sticky dots, all of round 2 are in this corner. Please vote with your dots over here, dot voting. The dot voting process is happening over here. Yes, it's on the floor over there. And we'll, you can go get it now. Just grab it and you can then find, you can already start putting it up if you'd like. Okay, we already have a round 3 presenter who is putting her poster on the wall. And that's what we should be doing. Round 3 people, the last people to present, please grab your poster and put it on 1 of the spaces on the wall. Vamanos. Okay, round 3 people. Round 3 people, any presenters for round 3? Every minute counts. If you haven't voted yet, over there in the corner. The round 3 posters are in the back of the room. The back over by the exit. All right, round 3, grab a spot. Let me get you some tape. All right, round 3 in very shortly. Very shortly.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20118.11): All\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (20120.37): right.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20129.41): Roll it. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20131.66): There\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (20133.92): you\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20138.44): go. Perfect.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20196.06): All right. Okay. Do we have all of the round 3 posters up? Does anybody own these posters? We have 3 posters for round 3. Hey, we need to just get everybody's\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20198.84): attention now. Okay.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20207.28): Okay, everybody, could I have everybody's attention, please?\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (20207.54): Could I\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20211.34): have everybody's attention please?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20214.34): Por favor.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20261.32): Okay. We have 3 posters from round 3 up here. Does anybody still need to present? Please. Please. Please. Please. Okay. Are there any missing, Does anybody still have to present? We have 3 models here, 3 posters. Going once? Going twice? I don't know. Okay. Okay. Does anybody claim this poster?\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (20261.62): Do you\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20300.00): want to present? Okay. All right. Okay. This is the last round. I think everybody knows the drill. 4 minutes to present. Don't forget to capture your feedback on sticky notes and put them on the wall, OK? Are you guys ready? And we need audience outside as well, so spread out. This is the last round, folks. Bear with us. Give everybody a chance to tell their story. And 30 seconds and I'll put the time up.\\n\\n[Speaker:13] (20317.44): Okay. Time to rotate. Let's rotate, please. We have 2 happening outside. Don't forget the 2 of them outside, okay? Let's rotate, please.\\n\\n[Speaker:15] (20381.74): We do all the restoration. We have over 60 models of restoration, which were built by our scientific team. So our scientific team is the most experienced scientists in the field of restoration. So they've done over 50,000 hectares of restoration. We have over 60 types of restoration. We are kind of the Sherlock Holmes or doctors of restoration. So we make an assessment, we understand the potential for natural regeneration and we plant, we'll see. And Our idea is to have a five-star restoration which means that we actually restore all the ecological processes. We're not against 3 stars or 2 stars restoration such as hotels\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (20394.48): of the former chief media man, who reported the kind of back-and-forth operatives, blah, blah, blah. But in a way, they have also made this to\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (20396.28): create their own sense.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (20399.58): It's not only about the lack of finance.\\n\\n[Speaker:13] (20411.74): Time's up. Time for feedback, please. 4 minutes, feedback.\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (20419.34): We\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (20427.10): have very serious problems, such as the fact that the plant is very small, without a proper level of professionalization, and there is no grass to fertilize the soil,\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20429.08): there are no crops.\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (20439.82): Our idea here is to start raising the level of professionalization by the cultivation of forested water operators. So we are going to see operators that were born in the model\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (20440.78): of forest water and\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (20442.70): other operators that have been in the forest for\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20443.58): a long time and are\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (20471.74): now migrating to the forest. There are several operations here in Brazil, and The return is much better. The model here is not based on land acquisition, the model that is based on partnership.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20537.26): To guarantee the safety of our land and our house. So unless you're so big to the platform, you can't go commit some name or to go track. There's a lot of work to get those things into place. And we think to get those things in place is our own proprietary operation. It's because then we're able to actually show and talk to you guys, finance, and provide information to our way to purchase more goods. So we use our own supplies as an example. Into a forest or it will be like growing out of the forestry in a place that already exists. No, we're talking about converting monocultures and degraded pastures into agricultural areas. So, and here there is a scientific reason you can say that you could generate more kind of products than\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (20539.50): any other type of products.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20564.18): Because you get like carbon on the soil, you get like carbon based area part, and this is like very well designed by science. Highlight, highlight this. What's the age of the process? So the incentive mechanism here is the returns they'll make will be followed to these different markets, whether it's the cows or the mountain poultry. Exactly.\\n\\n[Speaker:17] (20566.44): And they understand that proposal upfront.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (20566.70): Yeah,\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20570.78): exactly. And so what you're offering is a risk mitigation to reach that level\\n\\n[Speaker:17] (20574.76): by providing technical assistance and the platform to sell\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20609.66): the products. Exactly, exactly. And upfront carbon financing as well. Upfront carbon financing. Yeah, exactly. And should you select the trees or do they decide what these lands are? Were there any kind of forests on there before or there's nothing? No, we're focused on restoring areas that are, no trees on them. No trees on them. So how do you decide which trees to plant? So they're all locally adapted, so they're perfect for the agro-climatic conditions of that region. And we ourselves are focused on particular value chains, like coffee. And so coffee, cocoa, acai, and citrus are some of the main ones. And then a very large mix of native tree species that\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (20635.26): are the overstory of these\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (20651.72): Okay, last 4 minutes. Time for feedback for the last rotation 4 minutes for feedback\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (20704.18): So it's impressive, impressive work that Conexus does on the selecting and the technical systems. So this would only work with a Conexus in the middle. It can help us deal with, they have capillarity to work with all these competitors. And there is 1 startup, Beltera, who gets almost half of the financing to expand agroforestry systems. So we have among the producers who benefit from the structure, we have non-timber forest product, produce harvesters, so helping with adding value to the study forest. And we have this startup which works with Cocoa Agroforestry and links to carbon credits and to Cargill and their chocolate companies as of date. But we did it because\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20710.54): of the experimentation nature of it and the learning that we did at FSCAD.\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (20732.70): So hopefully as this matures, we are in the first year now, with track record from the PEP6 and also with further origination from Connexus and other cooperatives, they get matured together the structure and as we can get access to more, we can have more trans-state infrastructure.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20738.28): Who is financing the TA?

Raise those hands in the air, wave your hands. You got it, you got it.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20926.38): If you\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (20985.10): have not had a chance to vote on round 3, please take a minute to signal your preferred interest project. I see a few that have a conglomeration of dots, so then we'll go from there. But I will say that the following folks from rounds 1 and 2, Paolo Bellotti, are you here? You are 1 of the winners for round 1. Can I prevail upon you to come join us at the front? Marcelo, you are Also, you tied in round 1. Yes, so you're both, we've got 2 of you for round 1. Yes. And... Yay, winner! I know, I think people have a lot of questions about CFDA. Come on up.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (20986.22): What should we sing here?\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (20995.92): It's actually your choice, but you're encouraged to make up an interpretive dance to go along with whatever you choose to sing. Can I dance a little bit?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (20997.58): Yes, you can.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (21049.08): All right, and I believe it looks like for round 3 we have quite a few dots for this 1. It looks like it may be Jose joining us for round 3. We've got a pretty heavy concentration there, I think. All right. So this is good. We've got all the troublemakers up at the front. Yes, we'll bring another chair, because you're both...\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (21049.57): Yeah, yeah. All right. Because you're both.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (21079.84): All right. And so what we'll do for the next 45 minutes or So before we let you go to lunch, is have a conversation with these folks about some of the things that they might see in common with the models that they're doing. Where they might be having challenges or things to talk about. And we'll open it up to the wider group to talk about, you know, are you seeing these same issues and challenges? Where could you potentially offer a solution and what can we do with this? So our moderator for our little panel will be Rick Noguera.\\n[Speaker:6] (21080.16): Rick, do you\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (21083.14): want to say hi?\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21170.44): Hi, everyone. I'm Rick Noguera. See, I do speak English for people who are speaking Portuguese. It is actually my mother tongue. So that way when you heard me speak Portuguese and you said, has this guy have a brain damage or something? But the truth is, it's not my first language. All right, so how about, I mean, we had so many amazing ideas. But it would be nice to maybe get a quick little round of applause for these guys and for everybody's efforts for sitting through multiple rounds Everyone had to sit through multiple rounds in the US government CFDA is up there. That's amazing. That's perfect. Yeah, very good. So I think what we'll do, maybe I'll start with a question to the group and you guys can take it in turn. Maybe I'll start with Jouze here. All of you guys, and this is part of the reason you've gotten a bunch of little stickies, not only did you have interesting ideas, but there's an energy and excitement to your ideas, and you guys clearly were intent on doing these things and you were motivated by them. What about your ideas most excited? Like what's the thing that you know when you came here today and you and you must have had some part of your brain say I'm gonna have an opportunity to talk about this and I want to talk about this because I'm excited for these reasons. Giselle?\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (21185.34): I think that Brazil would have, I don't want to use unpolite words. I think that, I'll say hi.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (21187.90): See this is because we know you're the guy with the microphone.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (21195.10): So I turned them all\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (21259.26): I think that Brazil has missed so many opportunities in our history. We have a perfect track record in missing opportunities. But for the first time, we have an opportunity that we can't miss, is that transition to green economy. And agroforestry, in my opinion, is 1 of the most resilient economies that we can do. And it's a very good business to invest, highly profitable, but nobody knows about it. Everybody still thinks that agroforestry is something to be kept small, to be kept out of reach of the capital markets, and it's not. It can be a very decisive sector for our transition, our economic transition. That's why I'm so excited to talk about this project because we are seeing things getting done and in a way that you can include more people, create more, enhance our biodiversity, restore our areas, but not creating economic flights, but creating economic powerhouses. That's why I'm so excited about the idea.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21265.78): Very cool. Maybe I'll jump to Paulo, just because there was a little bit of overlap, maybe, with some of your ideas.\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (21266.02): I'm\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21268.36): curious what you're thinking. What are you thinking?\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (21315.96): I think more or less the same as Jos\\u00e9. I think for Brazil this is an opportunity. I compare like computing and biotech in the States or car manufacturing Korea. I think if Brazil wants to create a wealth in the country, I think this is the opportunity to explore consciously nature-based solutions. So it's for an impact investor as myself, it's a huge opportunity for systemic change. So that's why we are so excited about it. Marcelo?\\n\\n[Speaker:17] (21318.88): Well,\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (21482.70): the exciting part for me that it's been, I've been almost 40 years in this road is the fact that I can see the J curve finally getting up and Brazil taking potentially the lead. It has all the elements for that. It just came from Climate Week, and it's written all over. Brazil should lead, has the opportunity to lead. This, what we're doing here, is what needs to happen more often. And thank you guys for organizing this because this is really, really special. I've worn, all my life, I've worn 2 hats, missionary and mercenary. They're very aligned and they didn't have any conflict because they're directed to the same place. Now I abandoned the traditional mercenary to bring all the knowledge to focus here. And I think in addition to what my 2 colleagues mentioned here in terms of the business's specific areas of investment, We, and this is the new generation, this is the person that's going to carry the load very soon, is we focus in addition to pioneering those new markets. They're not really new. They're done in a different way now and in a much larger scale, but as to your point, we did 25-year rotation in agroforestry 38 years ago. So it's not new. It's just became famous now and people are discovering. There's 1 part that excites me very much and I think Marianne as well, which is finding new and untapped markets and that's the base of the pyramid. That until very recently, we couldn't reach. I'm going to say something very ugly here. I'm going to put my banker hat to say that. We don't see those people. They're invisible. We cannot bank them. We cannot finance them. They are not a market to be, you know, first to bother with because it's high transactional costs, super high risk, whatever it is, we're gonna name it, but it just doesn't happen. Now we do have the technology, the knowledge, and We have all of the elements to create a new and untapped market with all of the risk elements and all of the strategies, the knowledge and the technologies that we have developed so far. So this is the exciting bit. This is what excites me. And if you ask me what's my biggest KPI in doing this, building those markets where they don't exist, is to become obsolete. It means that we entered, enabled, and we left without being missed. That's my main KPO.\\n\\n[Speaker:17] (21484.46): That's great, yeah.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21485.82): Work yourself out of a job.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (21490.12): That's your mission. Exactly. Very good. Then go somewhere else.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21550.66): Now 1 thing I'm very happy to see with this panel is, so part of the reason we're all here today is really, in my mind, 2 big reasons. 1 is so that the U.S. Government can get a better sense of what's happening on the ground in Brazil, who the different players are, where the barriers are, where their needs are. But the other side of it is so that the Brazilian economy and the actors here can understand the tools that are available from the US government and what the motivations are of the US government. So I'm actually very happy to see that Anne is on this panel as well, because Anne is the chief of party for the Climate Finance for Development Accelerator, which is a USAID funded program. So may I have a slightly different question for you? Because I think part of the reason you're on is I keep hearing from people, how does that actually work? What is it? And maybe turn it over to you, maybe give a little bit of an idea of how CFDA is supposed to work, how it will work, and feel free to say why you're excited about it too.\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (21571.08): Well I'm really excited to be in this room with all of you creative people. I do not feel worthy to be on this panel with these folks who, you know, are really making things happen on the ground. But, yeah, I think maybe I'll describe it the way I tried to describe it in my illustration, which I apologize, I also don't feel worthy in terms of that drawing,\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (21574.08): that was my very poor drawing.\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (21746.72): But I look at CFDA as a tool in the US government's toolbox, for them to help you catalyze the growth in this sector around nature-based finance, nature-based finance for nature-based solutions. And so your first stop really, I think, should be talking with Kathy, Mark, Alex, Thomas, who are all in this room. You know, if your project is focused on Brazil, the Amazon, definitely chat with the USAID Brazil folks. If it's regional, talk with Thomas. They should be your first stop in terms of, you know, whether or not CFDA is a good fit, but really they can tell you, you know, does your project, does your fund, does your enterprise align with USAID objectives and priorities in the region or in the country, and kind of direct you to, like, help you make those connections. Maybe your fund is a better fit for a DFC or a better, or maybe there's some element that you need support from State Department to sort of crack the nut. So I would say definitely reach out to them, talk to them. It may be that CFDA is a good fit in terms of a tool in the toolbox in order to get maybe, you know, a piece of technical assistance that you can, that can help support or a little bit of catalytic funding maybe in the capital stack to act as first loss and pull in some other commercial investors. That's where we might come in, in terms of CFDA, and we can do a lot of different things. And I should point out that Rick, who also is part of Polla Nation, is part of our team. Mari from Crest Foundry is part of our team. We also have the climate policy initiative as part of our team. So there's a lot of different partners in the room too who are part of CFDA that you can talk to. But we all can work together and get really creative in terms of how we help you. That could be in terms of helping with capital raise, fundraising, connecting you with other donors, private sector investors, development finance institutions, and help crowding in that additional capital. It can be technical assistance. And 1 of the things that's really important for us is to make sure that the communities that are part of the deal structure or that are impacted by the deal structure are part of the design and have that sort of ownership as well. So where we can help create those opportunities to better engage them, to better include them, to make sure that they're part of that ownership structure, that's how we can help as well. And that's something that's really important for the US government and for CFDA in particular. So there's lots of different ways that we can work with you and get creative. So I'm excited to...\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21749.18): And what's the size of CFDA?\\n\\n[Speaker:9] (21768.44): So the USAID has committed $250 million in terms of the ceiling for funding under CFDA. Our objective is to mobilize $2.5 billion in private sector actions and private sector investments for climate mitigation and adaptation.\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (21770.04): Very cool, very cool.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21796.34): And it just started, right? So this is not 1 of those programs that's been up and running for a while and you may be a little late for. This is very much at the ground level, nothing in Brazil yet, I believe. So the open sign is up. You guys, really good to hear what made you excited. Is there anything that worries you? Like what do you think are the big barriers?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (21796.70): And this is\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21822.78): a good question even for CFDA. Like if you're thinking macro in Brazil, if we really wanna accelerate this, what are the barriers that should be addressed or need to be addressed, things that kinda worry you about whether or not Brazil's ever going to be able to make this sort of transition. Maybe I'll start, go over in reverse, start on that end. Mariana?\\n\\n[Speaker:18] (21839.00): From my point of view, I would like to answer your first question. I think that this is a particular momentum that we have different actors aligned with the common objective to develop and to boost the green economy of Brazil and Brazil be the leader of the green economy to the world.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (21839.22): So I\\n\\n[Speaker:18] (21895.50): think this is a very special moment that Marcelo has been 4 years on the road to get to here. So I'm very proud to be here and be part of this moment. In terms of the barriers, I think we talk about a lot of, in terms of funds and finance, but I think we need also to address the capacity and training barrier and also the talent barrier. We are just talking about, why don't you go to some state or other state? It's because we don't have people to implement those projects. We don't have people to, you know, supervise those projects. So I think this is something that really worries me. We are talking about labor in things, transformational projects,\\n[Speaker:16] (21898.66): Paulo?\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (21930.08): To me, it's capital. Really, we have to multiply by 10 times, 15 times the available capital very soon to make things happen. With capital, I think you have technical training, you have more entrepreneurs, you have success stories, failures that you can learn. But to me, the pin point is to increase the level of capital into the region as quickly as possible.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (21952.44): Just piggybacking on that, Brazil has a very large and sophisticated capital market.

I mean, the capital markets are very sophisticated and they work very well in Brazil, but as any capital market they have to put things into boxes. And the boxes are not really movable. I mean if I have a risk return this way that goes in this part and that box. And the sector now, as Jos\\u00e9 Pugas was developing his model and Leo as well and others here, All we are trying to do is to put these opportunities into these boxes. Once they are put into the boxes, the capital will flow tremendously and it's with a very strong moment. I think the capital that we need is to really bridge this gap, that we have to develop these initiatives that are now starting to make the risk return clear. So For that to happen, you need concessionary capital and patient capital. And once this is done, capital will flow through. We have an experience with the solar sector in Brazil that you know very well. And to me, when we started investing in solar 10 years ago, is the same landscape that we are facing now with nature-based solutions. And in the solar sector, after 10 years, Brazil is adding, I think the Americans here probably will not understand, but we are adding a Belo Monte, which is a large hydroelectric dam in Brazil, annually, without any public money. It's all private. It's 25, 30 billion reais per year that is flowing because we were able to put that into a specific box in the capital market. So we have to do this with nature-based solutions now. And to do this, we have to spend capital. We have to fail, learn, put more capital, and till we reach that level. My opinion.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (22091.48): Giuseppe, anything you want to add to that? Any reflections on this issue?\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (22202.94): I love when you mentioned solar energy. And It's very good for us to capture those specific histories in Brazil. When infrastructure started going to the capital market, nobody understood infrastructure. The first bonds for infrastructure, you remember quite well, they had 400 pages of safeguards and conditions. You hired an army of engineers to audit every little step, details on the size of the nail. Because we were, there was totally unknown territory. And financial sector gets very paranoid when it's an unknown sector. But now, everybody knows. Even the ones who don't really know, he thinks they know. So it's a question that I think that will happen in agroforestry, restoration, and so on. Carbon credits, 2 years ago, nobody knew about carbon credits. Now everybody's an expert in carbon credits. So we adapt very fast in Brazil. Solar Energy was an example, but you can go, our cooperatives, let's go to our sector. Our cooperatives, we have 18,000, 20,000 farmers connected to the same cooperative. No 1 else in the world has what we have. I know that the exploitation model of Cerrado is a disaster, but 50 years ago when it started, it wasn't. So let's not make an anachronic perspective of that. And we were able to do so. So when Brazilians decide to do something, we do. And that's what I think that will happen with nature-based solutions. For the first time, I see everyone convinced that the nature-based economy is the future of Brazil. Nobody disagrees about that. Nobody said Faria Lima. I think there are more people at the government that doubts about that than on Faria Lima currently.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (22203.22): All right,\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (22205.62): we'll have Marcelo, see a hand raised.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (22250.96): Just a quick point to corroborate to what Jos\\u00e9 was saying. You mentioned Brazil and you immediately associated with scale. You just mentioned the agribusiness. Scale, in my opinion, is 1 of the 3 main words that we need to create a viable for this. We need solution scale. NGOs do very nice projects at their scale and help a lot of people. But that's not a solution. The solution has to have the same scale of the problem and that's the kind of more capital that we're talking about because compared to the capital that were invested to create the problem, we need to have at least a similar context of capital to solve it.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (22304.86): All right, taking that point, and I wanna turn this a little bit to the broader audience, you're probably not gonna get that many opportunities where sitting in front of you is a bunch of different parts of the US government that want to hear what you have to say in terms of how they can help you. So what would you say to them? Like, what can they do to help you and to help these projects that you have here today? And then just hear briefly from, and maybe I'll skip CFDA, because, hear briefly from these 3 projects, and then maybe turn it to the audience, because other folks who also have very good projects and very good ideas can maybe add on to this and maybe we can maybe hear from some of our USG folks here the way they kind of view what they're hearing. So maybe I'll maybe I'll start right here on my right. Shizetsu You have a microphone in your hand.\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (22463.14): It would be very philosophical, very objective. But first of all, understanding. Understand how we operate. Understand that we can do things by ourselves. But we want to do that with you. Most of the times when we are discussing with the global north, there's a question of, it seems that, OK, we are doing that for you. No, you have to do that for you. We are doing that for us, but we can do it together. So to be more symmetrical on our negotiations is the first step for really try for anything else. Everything is possible if you will respect ourselves at the same level at a table. So if you do so, we can start discussing. But be more objective, guarantees will be great. I think that supply, to have more closeness, more proximity to supply chains, to connect, not just about capital, we're talking about supply chains, so for example, Cargill, Mondelez, Mars, many of the food produced here in aquifers are sold to the US, are exported to the US. We're not talking about cattle ranging, we're not talking about beef, soy, we're not talking about products that we are competing. We're talking about products that we can reproduce and you buy. So to keep this better proximity between the 2 sides of the supply chain is strategic for us to achieve scale models for that. Because supply chain finance is something that can be really disruptive for our relationships. And more than that, I said tomorrow, I'll say it again, we don't need cheap capital, what we need is patient capital. So when you have patient capital, when you have first loss, when you have second loss, when you have the guarantee, we go out of the discussions of FX, Currency Volatility. We are not discussing about that. I know there is stuff for you and for us. But it really risks the operations. It has a full impact, because we have capital in Brazil. We're not talking about a place that doesn't have capital. We have a lot of capital here. But the capital is too at first risk. Every capital is at risk at first. Brazil as well. So if you reduce the risk, through your soft power, through the US soft power, it's a fair strong brand and I don't see US government applying that well in Brazil. Use that soft power, provide the supply chains, print the credit guarantees and this pipeline is only 0.5% of what we can trigger on the first year.\\n\\n[Speaker:11] (22466.30): Paulo?\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (22507.60): Well, I think the risking is, but also ideas, increasing demand for carbon credits, I think that is a trigger. Also making companies buy commodities, mainly cocoa for instance, at fairer prices and conditions, that will have an effect. Pressuring also, I'm not sure if the US government can do that.\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (22508.00): You're not\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (22514.26): sure if the US government can pressure people?\\n\\n[Speaker:1] (22559.10): That was ironic. That was an irony. I think fair trade conditions, I think deforestation in the Amazon is caused mainly by beef producers. I think there is a pinpoint there as well that can be put at scale with good effects. I think, But as Jos\\u00e9, I think a dialogue, what we started today here, or yesterday, it's a very, very good start, very, very good start.\\n\\n[Speaker:18] (22588.24): I think we do have in the US a model of the Inflation Reduction Act, of the biggest green and sustainable program in the world. And the world is expecting from Brazil a position about that. So anything that we could have from US in terms of public policy and regulatory that will enable this flow of capital to Brazil, I think, would be,\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (22589.04): you know,\\n\\n[Speaker:18] (22594.72): you get the things in.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (22599.42): I'm gonna elaborate here. Absolutely. All right,\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (22639.48): so maybe we can turn it To the audience a little bit, because all of you have the same benefit that these guys have, which is you have people listening closely from the US government, a US government that views Brazil as a strategic partner on climate. Anything anybody else wants to add? What can the US do in Brazil to kind of help move these markets along, help Brazil remain and continue on a trajectory that is low carbon and more sustainable? I see Philip.\\n\\n[Speaker:19] (22643.32): Hello, thank you. I think the number 1, I don't\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (22644.02): know if we call it a\\n\\n[Speaker:19] (22685.68): piece of advice or comment, would be around speed. I think that dealing with US government or any government or any development bank as an entrepreneur is incredibly slow. It is not the speed that the projects and the entrepreneurs are moving at, and it's extremely frustrating. And so I think that obviously you guys have, everyone has a ton of work, and there's different processes, and you're overwhelmed or whatever, but I think that like moving, like you know, Facebook model, move quickly and break things. I think it's okay to move quickly and make some mistakes, because you're gonna make a lot of more, you're gonna do a lot of things correctly if you're moving quickly, especially with the people in this room.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (22729.98): I will say we'll take anybody else's comments, but also if anybody from our US government attendees also has things they'd like to add to this conversation, either tools or approaches that you think that you're ready to bring to bear or things that you can do to help alleviate some of these bottlenecks, or just comments on the conversation so far. The floor is open to you as well. Other comments or reactions? Particularly if it's something around, here is a pain point for me. And based on the conversations we've had over the last day or so, I see an opportunity for engagement with the US government to help alleviate that pain point.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (22736.12): So we've heard speed. Yes, okay.\\n\\n[Speaker:17] (22946.12): Okay, well to get the ball rolling from the US government side, I know you guys want speed, so I'm trying to be quick here. Laughter 1 thing I think, what I've, my experience over the past 3 or 4 years, you know, there are so many nascent markets, right now. And the US is the most, is the hyper capitalist society in the world. You all know that, especially from the financial markets. I used to work in the financial markets in New York city. And we're getting attention from big funds in the United States. They come to us. They say, look, we've got plenty of capital, just like you said. You say there's a lot of capital in Brazil. There's even more in the United States. Looking for productive outlets, looking for viable projects in the Amazon. And they've come to us and they're working here already. They've come to Brazil, they've come to Paraguay, they're looking at Peru. And they asked me, well, you know, I get 500, 600 proposals a day from the Amazon basin. And I asked him, well, then how do you select? I said, well, very carefully. And the main issue, and I've said this before, is the particular governance structure of where they're going to invest, be that as a debt, equity, patient capital, you name it. They get everything. They get all the above of why this is a smart investment. But to take it and land it in a context that they're unfamiliar with is not easy. So what are we doing? Well, our mission director in Peru, the previous mission director, he decided to sponsor global conferences or be a sponsor of global conferences. So we would go as USAID and meet with these big corporates that want to invest in forestry and biodiversity. They didn't know we were playing in the space. So we, as the U.S. Government, we need to make sure that the players and stakeholders understand we're in this game, for lack of a better word. And our comparative advantage is that we've been in these countries for over 60 years. And We know the stakeholders at the district, at the regional, at the national level, and even the private sector. We're getting the word out, and we're sort of the intermediary. The great thing about having CFDA sitting with you is that the contract such as CFDA was created through an accelerated procurement vision by USCID. The idea is to, we hear everybody saying we're very slow as a US government, but we're implementing contracting mechanisms that accelerate the process, so it's not 2 years to get something up and running, it can be 2 months. And that's the beauty of the CFDA, and other contracts you've had, like Invest and Catalyze, that are also global contracts. So we're getting there. But the beauty, what I love about this whole meeting is that we're learning from you. And the different kind of examples, models I've seen are fascinating. And I'd love to bring those that are viable to Peru. Naturally, each context is different, and what drives our success is understanding the context. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (22982.50): Thanks, I'll just keep these ones brief as well, and get more concluding thoughts later in terms of what we're seeing here. But a quick point on the speed. The speed's always a tough 1, and it's going to remain a tough 1. The reality is that if you lose a dollar and you waste it, that is far more damaging than having poor results. We can have a program that fails, and that's not good, and we should hold ourselves totally accountable. Losing a dollar to corruption or something like that. The whole idea is around predicating. Remember, it's taxpayer dollars we're spending. No, it's my parents, it's my brother's, it's your uncle's money. So we take it super seriously.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (22982.70): So the\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (23095.26): whole thing is predicated on protection, not on speed. So you're fighting an uphill battle in the beginning. Everyone's gotta remember that. So I always need to defend the US government a little bit because We're predicated to be slow. We're predicated to protect, not predicated to move. That's it. We're trying to be much better. And we've made tremendous strides in terms of procurement. We're doing a procurement now in our mission in Brazil. I keep asking a team to go back and double check because the rules seem so easy. I'm like, God, this is not what I remember 4 years ago. And I can talk freely about this? Really? I can co-create in a real, actually good, collaborative fashion? Where's my professional protection? Because the whole thing is about competition. That's the other predicated part of our procurement. It's all about not, you know, guarding against nepotism. I like you, and there you go, we have a conversation, and you bought me dinner, and I'm going to give you a contract. Everything is out there to protect that, and that's good. That's a really important procurement principle that, you know, most countries in the world need to improve on, including ours, but at least we have it right, dead center in terms of why we do what we do. That said, I'm gonna challenge a little bit what Thomas is saying on some level, not arguing against it, but I think another fallacy we have, which we're trying to change, is we projectize everything. Everything's a project. A project is not something the private sector does. They have businesses. There's transactions. We make projects. And we put ourselves in the center of the universe, and so do other people. IFC, IDB, World Bank, bilateral programs. And even sometimes I think you hear it here. It's like, I got a project. You got a hopefully a viable business idea, not a project. And we start organizing around projects, you think of yourselves differently. We at USG, as I said before, it makes us the center of our own universe. And we try to figure out who to partner with. So as much as the contracts are good, and the programs are good, and the projects are good, what we're learning that is it's the talent of our people, it's our convening authority, with some of\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23096.32): those projects as a way\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (23122.20): to be nimble, and hopefully faster, it's tools, It's the combination that will make us effective. It's the ecosystem we have to work toward. And that's the ability I say later, too, that that's not just us. That's you, too. I mean, everyone kind of starts with their own banner first. And that's OK. That's how you motivate. That's how you organize. That's how you get excited. That's how you partner. But partner is probably gonna be the answer, not rally, right?

You know, we used to joke that AIE is a contracting, you're an AID officer, you're a contractor. We have contracting officials within AID, but we're not contractors. If we simply are just passing through money and we have the vision and we have, and then we think we have the answers, and then we just figure out a way to spend our money and then monitor you to spend our money, we're missing out a ton of creativity, a ton of innovation, and we'll never get the job done. Because we can't afford it. As I said before, we can't write a check. If we could, we probably would do it. So I take you on the capital point for sure. I think it's part of it, but I don't think it's the only thing. I think 1 of the challenges that I will say later too is that people who come from a capital perspective can't just hold themselves to the capital perspective. They have to broaden it. Yes, we need to make the funders comfortable, but that's not the only job we have. There's actual people's lives at stake here who have far more pressing needs than making investors comfortable.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23178.88): So we're\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (23191.00): going to have to break down some of those battles as well a little bit and say, I got your perspective, you got mine. Often I think they took the opposite for years and said, We didn't understand the private sector, and ergo, we were kind of useless in\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23191.36): trying to mobilize your capital.\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (23242.82): And now the pendulum's going way the other direction. Almost everything is about trying to make investors happy. The real people we need to make happy are the people we're trying to serve, all of us, on some level, including investors, including the business cycle, but not only the business cycle. So it's a little bit about wide perspectives. It's about how we are. We, the US government, need to make sure we don't projectize everything and make that our only unit of departure, because then we see the world a certain way. I think some of our other experiences around the room have shown us that when you break open how governments work with partners, work with employee partners, sometimes, in my last job, this very same partner was all of the above. It became tricky, because we had rules against how we could talk to you when we give you our money. We got to relate with you in a certain way. We have rules, and we can just talk and be advocacy partners. And we both have the same idea. We both want to bring solar power to health clinics in Africa. But when it's the same person who I actually\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23243.56): have a contract with to\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (23274.24): do this 1 thing, where advocacy department is over here, we sit on the same table at the ministerial over here, it becomes very blurred, but that's probably okay. We're gonna have to wade into that risky water and figure out how to make sure we don't break any laws and rules, because those are incredibly important. As I mentioned before when I started here, that's the first thing you get your can. There's very few things you get your can today. 1 of them is procurement screw-ups. So you've gotta make sure you do that, but it doesn't mean we can't take the risk of figuring out how to better partner with each other. So I think that's my biggest takeaway.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (23304.12): Thank you. I saw a lot of nodding heads over the past few comments and so I was just going to open up the floor If there was anything else people wanted to raise in terms of either things they would like to just share with the US government folks that are in the room, things that you were kind of hoping we'd hit on and didn't, or if other facets of the US government wanted to kind of chime in from their perspective on either the bottle decks that were discussed here and the kind of the worries of our private sector partners versus the types of support and tools that your departments and agencies can bring to bear.\\n\\n[Speaker:16] (23304.88): I just wanted to give\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (23313.72): you the opportunity to do that. Evan.\\n\\n[Speaker:20] (23392.80): I wanted to actually in a different direction and not really reflect so much on US government opportunities but you know I think heard a really lot of amazing ideas, a lot of which are already kind of under implementation. But I think 1 thing I saw in common for so many of them was the need for a tremendous amount of capacity for the folks on the ground doing the analysis, doing the capacity building, understanding what were the opportunities, building up the investment. It's just a lot of manpower, people power involved there. And I'm just curious, I mean, it seems like potentially a real bottleneck to doing good work and you know are there ways that you think there can we can think about improving that network of capacity as well as you know systems of data and information that would help address some of those those challenges and if people have reflection on that. There's only so many So many people available to do this kind of work, and it takes a lot of skill.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (23400.74): We'll go Deborah first, and then.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (23404.58): I want to pick up on what Jose said. I don't know where he went.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23405.28): He had to leave.\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (23540.82): He had to leave. Okay. So, Lucas said the use of the US government as soft power, and I thought that was really important and Mark you said the convening power. I think that this room is representative of the fact that there is a sector here, it's nascent, it's growing. Some have been out for 40 years, some 15, some whatever. But it is at that tipping point. And the imprimatur and, of course, the resources of the US government, the convening power, blended perhaps with a couple of other governments that are key in this, blended with some of the philanthropies that are really, really leaning forward in this, both US global, European and Brazilian philanthropies, can create a really powerful landing spot for international capital, can create the enabling infrastructure, market infrastructure to have this market not only see itself, but be connected and then of course create that strong landing spot for U.S. Capital, but European capital or international capital. And I think that's, as you said, it's all here in this room and outside of this room. But I do think that there is a power in having the US government as that soft power convening convener, whether you're the 1 convening or whether you're joining with others in processes that are already underway outside of this room around convening and leader players. I think being at the table and providing that leadership certainly helps bring others along. Even if you're number 2 or number 3 in the lineup. I don't know whether that resonates for others, but I just wanted to throw that out.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (23545.34): Thank you. Marcello, did you have a hand up before we?\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (23657.72): Just a quick comment about the comment on people, how to mobilize. We are small, we've never been big. We talk big and we've done some things big, but in our experience, there's no institution, even, well, American government's a different thing, there's no institution that has the best know-how for each 1 of the issues we need to address on a landscape approach. There are multiple issues. Even if they are the same, we're talking about fish farming earlier today with a colleague. The fish farming in Rondonia is completely different than in Nakala in northern Mozambique. It could even be the same thing, but it's totally different. So the know-how to address that is very, very different. So as an institution, as a business model, since we were born, we decided we would never be able to acquire know-how enough in-house to do all of that. So we developed Know Who. We don't know who is the best in class to do \\u2013 you've got a landscape approach, you have 15 different areas of expertise. I don't know \\u2013 I'm not an expert in any of those, but I know who is. And ideally, you offer the opportunity to the locals, and then to the regionals, and then to the internationals. And the job description reads, you come and deliver this, this is the value, this is the budget, and part of your job is to form your replacement, is to build the capacity locally to replace your knowledge so you don't have to come back to the region. So that's how we solve it. I'm just sharing our experience from your point.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (23662.82): Other thoughts or comments people wanna make? Yes.\\n\\n[Speaker:21] (23911.90): So building on a lot of what we've heard today, I think that until very recently, all these different initiatives were fragmented or were scattered or were fragmented projects, as Mark said before. And I think that More recently, we have been able to get momentum, and Brazil is at the tip and should lead more and more of this momentum. But 1 of the things that we understood is that we needed to bring this together. These scattered, fragmented initiatives were difficult to map, difficult for, for example, the US government to understand as a whole and put everything organized. And this is 1 of the things that I think is great about the vision of what we're doing at Capital for Founders was to help organize this landscape. And how do you organize this landscape? Well, first you have to understand who are the people in Brazil who are the leaders in this, in these initiatives and these investments, and put them together to exchange ideas of how to move forward. And this is 1 of the things that we have done, and several of you in the room are part of this, and we would like to have more constituents coming in to be part of this group to discuss the opportunities so that we can scale. The other part is, well, what are the deals? These different projects. They're all scattered, fragmented. So we organize the pipeline. So we're organizing a pipeline, clusterized, in developers, in funds that have different mandates, be it equity or debt, because you have both of them and highly developed in Brazil. And then the companies, the enterprises themselves, and link all this to foreign capital. And so to the different pockets of institutional investors, foundations, family offices, all this capital which is huge, in the trillions, that wants to be unlocked, but didn't know how. So creating a safe haven for where to look at and find an organized pipeline and find leaders, regional, Brazilian leaders that are investing in this place that are a safe and 1 place to look at is probably a way to go. And the government, the US government can certainly play a big role in this by helping this to scale, not just with the funds, but also the connections like Anne mentioned, that you can make the connections to the different pools of capitals. And we can promote this more organized nature-based solution sector and the different categories within it, be it developers, funds, enterprises, so that everything is simpler for the foreign capital to understand and be comfortable to invest in. So I think there's a huge role that the US government can play. And also in terms of other scaling services that are needed and we had several discussions with people in the room today about blended finance. And this is certainly something that, you know, you can do it in different places. And there are commendable initiatives like Marcelo was describing, me and Mato Grosso. But we need to make a robust facility, in my mind, of blended finance, like robust, with first loss. And the US government and its different pockets that you can link us to could be a big player in this, so that we have a robust layer of first loss. And then we can bring in the other capitals by Brazilian banks or the Brazilian capital markets to take the different de-risked tranches. So that's I think is another way for the government to contribute. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (23912.22): Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24025.34): I think Leo might have had 1 last. No, you're good? Okay. I'm gonna just kind of wrap us up for this session and give you a taste of the rest of the day. So in a moment we'll deconvene, I'm gonna break up, and head to lunch. I'll just ask, after lunch, we'll generally just have an open session for people to be chatting, continue the conversations you had before. As we mentioned earlier, I have a schedule going so that if you would like to have a one-on-one with 1 of the U.S. Government representatives who are here in the room, please just come talk to me before you go to lunch, and I'll make sure that we can get you just anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes of just a pull aside to have that conversation. Otherwise, after lunch it will just be some conversations among each other for about 2 hours and then we'll do a final wrap-up and head off to some refreshments at the end of the day. So this will be our transition to lunch, but again, come see me if you'd like to schedule a short meeting with the US government. Thank you. Oh, yes, hold on. 1 more thought. Ah, separately, we would love to capture, because it was very hard to kind of document everybody's models as you were talking in groups. Mark is going to set up a little video booth. And so If everybody can spend literally 2 minutes, come with a partner, come by yourself if you had your own model, and come join the booth for 2 minutes to just give us a quick overview of what's in your model, what excites you, and where you see the potential for collaboration. And we will capture you there so that we can put all these things together and share them back with our US government counterparts and hopefully spur some additional conversations down the line.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (24052.94): We will come get you either before or after lunch. We have 2 video cameras, we can actually do 2 at a time. Eduardo and Eduardo Legato will also do this. And also during the networking. So We've already gotten Ricardo, I think, yes? So we just want to make sure we get a little recording from everybody, we'll have the prompts for you. We'll come to you, so thank you very much.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24053.20): And in\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24086.94): terms of the networking after lunch, again, come see me before lunch. After lunch, we will let you know where and when your meetings will be. So but it will be in this general area.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24089.98): We\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (24118.10): had we had\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (24132.58): Okay. Grab a seat. Grab a seat, please. Jazz hands, jazz hands, let's see the jazz hands. Come on now.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24132.90): Put your\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (24146.85): hands in the air and give it a shake. What does it mean again? All right. All right.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24149.46): We would\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (24149.75): like to do 1 last\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24151.29): thing before we close. And so I will\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24151.62): ask if you're sitting\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24163.76): at a table that only has 1 or 2 people at it, join a table with more people. Just find yourselves a big table.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24178.24): Thank you. We'll finish together. I made a quote.\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (24186.80): Hey, y'all. In the interest of saving the environment, your lanyards have been used like 3 or 4 times. We'd like to use them again.\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (24187.20): So if\\n\\n[Speaker:0] (24197.34): you could just leave them on your table, that would be great. We'll pick them up and take them to the next USAID affair. Thank you very much. And\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24217.20): here we go. All right. So this is going to be very, very challenging, okay? We know that everybody has had a wall. We've been doing this for 2 days. We will not make you think too hard. But what we would like each table to do, take 5 minutes here, this is not a long thing. What's 1 thing that you want the rest of the group to take away from the last 2 days?\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (24218.08): Okay, have\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24235.06): somebody write it down so that we make sure that we've captured what it is. And we will quickly go around the room just to keep this moving and forward. So again, if you're sitting alone or with just 1 or 2 people at a table, come join a bigger 1.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24235.30): And in\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24242.96): the next 5 minutes, come up as a group with 1 thing you'd like everybody to take away from the last 2 days\\n\\n[Speaker:3] (24271.34): okay 5 minutes\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24292.44): Okay. Who's ready to be done with today? Is everybody ready? I'm going to get out my giant vaudeville hook that I've been using all afternoon and yoink you all into submission here. All right. Thank you all for sticking it out to the very end. It has been wonderful to have your participation.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24292.80): We're going\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24298.32): to take about 5 minutes to go around the room.

That we'll just do jazz hands all the time. I need to learn how to whistle through my fingers. I'm watching you. All right. Thank you all very, very much.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24324.18): I am\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24342.50): going to start by handing the microphone off to this table. So you're gonna tell us 1 thing you want everybody to take away from this round table and you will pass the microphone to the next table, okay?\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24342.78): Oh, it's\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (24343.18): gonna be\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (24344.92): a very long and elaborate response.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24348.50): I know. That's why I didn't give you the microphone at first.\\n\\n[Speaker:10] (24353.52): Okay. We should do more of this. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:12] (24359.04): Not really. Seriously.\\n\\n[Speaker:22] (24387.94): So the takeaway from our group was just the need to understand and be aware of what else is out there and what other types of initiatives that other organizations are working on that might be similar and fostering better coordination in a way that's brilliant, voluntary, specific, and purposeful and rapid to really make sure that we're really being effective in what we're doing, not reduplicating anything, finding where there are synergies and being able to act quickly.\\n\\n[Speaker:21] (24391.44): Oh, that's all.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24404.94): All right. Table 3. I see a lot of things on that post-it note\\n\\n[Speaker:5] (24425.32): There's amazing talent here in this room in Brazil, period, with great investable opportunities that require capital and scale up enablers, where the US government is positioned to make a big difference and is eager to do so as a key partner.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24431.16): That was lovely, thank you. So there's your marketing materials for this event. 28 people\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (24434.66): are at the table, that's not enough.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24434.86): Yep, I\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24444.58): was going to say that's your fact sheet. All right.\\n\\n[Speaker:2] (24497.24): So the 1 takeaway from our group, which is sort of elaborated as well, is the fact that we are, we don't know all the answers to what we want to achieve yet and we're not experts yet, but that together we can go further by combining our strategies and efforts to tackle this huge challenge that we have. And this great team with a diversity of models and ideas can understand better how to work together and understand what everyone is doing and by then create actionable and concrete actions.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24505.40): All right. And our last table who would like to be our rapporteur?\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (24512.28): Okay, so we had a few things, and I've tried to make a very quick haiku.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24514.04): The overachievers at the last table.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24514.16): I\\n\\n[Speaker:8] (24535.00): know. Well, actually the text comes from the table, so putting the pieces together. Opportunities. Patience Unlocks Capital. Network Opens Channels.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24535.46): There's your\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24563.96): tweet. Alright, so I actually I would like to thank you all for joining, but I would like to invite Mark, James, and Daniel to come up to the front of the room just to say some closing words for us in a quick thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:23] (24570.26): I just want to say thank you to everybody. This has been great. I can't believe 2 days has gone by in\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24570.80): the flash\\n\\n[Speaker:23] (24593.04): of an eye. I learned an enormous amount over the last couple of days. I hope you can all say the same thing. It's been great getting to see many of you again. It's been great getting to know many of you better or meet some of you for the first time. I love you all. Let's keep in touch.\\n\\n[Speaker:7] (24640.16): Today I found myself saying over and over again in my one-on-one meetings that this is such a good time for Brazil and for this agenda in Brazil. You have a federal government that is really ambitious, really forward leaning. You have a US government that is a committed partner and wants to support Brazil. And then you have an amazing community of actors in the private sector finance space who have ideas and things they want to get done. And it just gives me incredible hope for the next year, the next 2 years, the next 3 years, the next 5 years. And we're so excited we put this together because now it gives us the opportunity to really form relationships and work with you and take advantage of this really amazing moment. So thank you all for coming. We're really glad we did this. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24640.50): Yeah, I'm\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (24650.34): just going to say thanks as well. I mean, I think at the end of the day, I've said a lot about different things. We don't want to be the center of the universe. We want to make sure we fit in with the rest of you\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24650.48): and your ideas\\n\\n[Speaker:14] (24732.66): and your creativity and your thoughts. I think the USG can do that. I think we can be quicker as we do what we try. And I think the underlying point of what was said in a lot of these tables, some fancy than others, some of it in haiku, is we have to work together, right? And I think the time is obviously the good time, but it's also the only time. So a bit of a takeaway, right? We really have to get on this. We have to figure out a way to take these good ideas and shove our institutional egos to the door and say, I heard that idea over there and I'm not gonna remit the wheel and how do I get on board with this train and maybe you and I can work together and I saw a few of those things happen for sure. Certainly if you're like me and you heard the ideas, a lot of them have similarities and shared interests and shared focus And some of them had wonderful complementarities already built in. So this is just about 1 small room of people, but a good 1. So thanks for sharing that. Again, first conversation on a last, let's make sure we keep it up, not only with us, but within this, right? It has to be an ecosystem approach, has to be regimented. We have to draw more people in, and we can't forget to get the voices of the people we actually are trying to support the most in addition to the ecosystems they live in. So always hold ourselves accountable to say at the end of the day, you know, it's not just us, it isn't just finance, it isn't just government, it isn't just policy, it's people, and people have to live in these biomes and that's the only way we'll be able to make them sustainable over time. Thanks.\\n\\n[Speaker:4] (24768.47): All right so for anybody who's able to stay, we're gonna walk over to Garoa Bar, which is about 4 blocks away. I and my Google Maps will lead us. And just come join us for a bit. It would be lovely to just kind of take this to an even more casual setting. So we'll walk out of here in maybe five-ish minutes or so, give everybody a chance to pack up, get your act together, and we'll continue en masse. But thank you all again. It was a pleasure getting to do this with you. So. Thank you.\\n\\n[Speaker:6] (24770.16): Thank you all.\", \"Template_Section_List\": [{\"Section_Title\": \"\", \"Content_Topics\": \"\", \"Speakers\": \"[Speaker:#]=[Real_Name]\", \"Time_Start\": \"\", \"Time_End\": \"\", \"Value_Score\": \"x/10\"}]}\n",

            "Key Insights:\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23178.50): The US Government (USG) is not a project developer and should not act as one. Instead, it should leverage the creativity and innovation of its partners to achieve its goals, as it cannot afford to do everything on its own.\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23191.00): There is a need to balance perspectives between the private sector and the government. While the private sector's capital perspective is important, it should not be the only perspective considered. The ultimate goal should be to serve the people, not just to make investors happy.\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23242.82): The USG needs to avoid \"projectizing\" everything and instead work more collaboratively with partners. This includes navigating the complexities of rules and regulations when working with partners who are also contractors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendations:\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23178.50): The USG should continue to find ways to leverage the creativity and innovation of its partners, rather than trying to do everything on its own.\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23191.00): Stakeholders should strive to balance the capital perspective with other perspectives, with the ultimate goal of serving the people.\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23242.82): The USG should work towards breaking down barriers and fostering more collaborative relationships with its partners, even when those partners are also contractors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Quotes:\n",
            "- [Speaker:14] (23178.50): \"If we simply are just passing through money and we have the vision and we have, and then we think we have the answers, and then we just figure out a way to spend our money and then monitor you to spend our money, we're missing out a ton of creativity, a ton of innovation, and we'll never get the job done.\"\n",

            "- [Speaker:12] (21550.66): The panel discussion aims to help the U.S. Government understand the situation in Brazil, identify key players, barriers, and needs, and also to help the Brazilian economy understand the tools and motivations of the U.S. Government.\n",
            "- [Speaker:9] (21746.72): The Climate Finance for Development Accelerator (CFDA) is a tool in the U.S. government's toolbox to catalyze growth in the sector around nature-based finance for nature-based solutions. It can provide technical assistance and catalytic funding to projects that align with USAID objectives and priorities.\n",
            "- [Speaker:9] (21768.44): USAID has committed $250 million for funding under CFDA with the objective to mobilize $2.5 billion in private sector actions and investments for climate mitigation and adaptation.\n",
            "\n",
            "Recommendations:\n",
            "- [Speaker:9] (21746.72): Those interested in CFDA should first talk with Kathy, Mark, Alex, Thomas, and USAID Brazil folks to understand if their project aligns with USAID objectives and priorities. They can help make connections and identify if CFDA is a good fit or if other tools like DFC or State Department support might be more suitable.\n",
            "- [Speaker:9] (21746.72): CFDA can help with capital raise, fundraising, connecting with other donors, private sector investors, development finance institutions, and crowding in additional capital. It can also provide technical assistance and ensure that communities impacted by the deal structure are part of the design and ownership structure.\n",

He emphasizes the importance of partnerships and creativity in addressing complex problems like the Amazon. He also discusses the need for risk mitigation strategies, not just concessional capital, to make projects viable.\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): The speaker suggests that USAID could potentially create a tool to quickly mobilize certain capacities under contract to support partners. He also discusses the idea of time-bound cost of capital as a more interesting approach to concessional capital.\n",
            "- [Speaker:9] (8401.15): The speaker asks about discussions within USAID regarding biodiversity credits, indicating an interest in this area from Climate Policy Initiatives.\n",

            "Recommendations:\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): The speaker recommends that partners communicate their needs to USAID, including the types of support they wish USAID would provide, such as feasibility studies, legal fee coverage, and concessional capital. He also encourages partners to help USAID understand their needs with greater fidelity.\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): The speaker suggests that USAID should explore innovative ways to use concessional capital, such as insuring risk or recycling money within a project, rather than just providing a pool of capital to buy down the capital stack.\n",
            "\n",
            "Quotes:\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): \"There's an old aid and a new aid, I hope. And the old aid put ourselves in the center of every universe and said, do you want to work on a program? Here's how you apply. And our starting point was us. But I think new aid says it's about partnerships.\"\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): \"We want to give you free money. We want to give you concessional money. And we have some ways of doing it better than others. The caveat to this is that if we put all our money, every dollar we can spend and put it in 1 pool and say, here's concessional capital, it would go like that. And I think we can be more effective than that.\"\n",
            "- [Speaker:10] (8367.23): \"There's gotta be something different we can do, something we can hold ourselves to be more innovative on to get to a better solution. Because simply, we obviously can't provide the concessional capital you need fast enough with minimum bureaucracy and minimum requirements that have worked, so we wouldn't be having the conversation again.\"\n",

            "## Contextual Background\n",
            "The Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region is endowed with a wealth of biodiversity that plays a crucial role in the global ecological balance. The conservation of this biodiversity is imperative not only for the intrinsic value of the natural world but also for the myriad ecosystem services it provides to humanity. However, the region faces numerous challenges, including deforestation, habitat loss, and the impacts of climate change, which threaten its environmental integrity and the sustainability of its natural resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Brief Overview of the Conservation Finance Landscape\n",
            "Conservation finance represents a critical avenue for addressing these challenges by mobilizing and managing capital to achieve conservation outcomes. It encompasses a variety of financial instruments and strategies designed to support the protection, restoration, and sustainable management of natural resources. Despite its potential, the conservation finance landscape in the LAC region remains underdeveloped, with a significant funding gap impeding the full realization of conservation goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Importance of Innovative Finance for Nature in the LAC Region\n",
            "Innovative finance mechanisms offer a promising solution to bridge this gap. By leveraging new and non-traditional sources of finance, such as impact investments, green bonds, and payment for ecosystem services, there is an opportunity to enhance the scale and effectiveness of conservation efforts in the LAC region. These mechanisms can also align economic incentives with environmental objectives, fostering sustainable development and resilience.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Roundtable Highlights\n",
            "The INRM Conservation Finance Roundtable provided a platform for key stakeholders to discuss the potential of innovative finance for nature conservation in the LAC region. The roundtable featured insightful presentations and dynamic discussions, shedding light on the current state of conservation finance and exploring forward-thinking approaches to funding conservation initiatives.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Key Topics Discussed During the INRM Conservation Finance Roundtable\n",
            "Participants engaged in dialogues on a range of topics, including the role of public-private partnerships, the integration of indigenous knowledge into conservation finance, and the utilization of technology to enhance transparency and monitoring. The discussions also delved into the challenges and successes of existing projects, offering practical insights into the application of innovative finance solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Summary of the Most Innovative and Impactful Ideas Presented\n",
            "The roundtable surfaced several innovative and impactful ideas, such as the development of blended finance structures that combine philanthropic, public, and private capital. Other notable concepts included the creation of conservation trust funds and the implementation of incentive-based conservation programs that reward sustainable practices.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Strategic Insights\n",
            "An analysis of the roundtable discussions revealed a strong potential for innovative finance mechanisms to transform conservation efforts in the LAC region. However, the successful implementation of these mechanisms will require a supportive policy environment, capacity building among local stakeholders, and the establishment of clear metrics for impact measurement.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Identification of Challenges and Opportunities for Implementation\n",
            "The roundtable identified several challenges to the uptake of innovative finance, including regulatory barriers, limited awareness among investors, and the need for technical expertise. Conversely, the region presents numerous opportunities, such as a growing interest in sustainable investment and the presence of diverse ecosystems that can serve as living laboratories for innovative finance models.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Recommendations\n",
            "To capitalize on these insights, a prioritized list of actionable recommendations was developed for the U.S. Government and other stakeholders. These include enhancing cross-sectoral collaboration, investing in capacity development for local communities and financial institutions, and promoting enabling policies that facilitate investment in nature-based solutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Suggestions for Fostering Partnerships and Leveraging Resources\n",
            "The roundtable underscored the importance of fostering partnerships between governments, the private sector, NGOs, and local communities. It also highlighted the need to leverage resources effectively, including the strategic use of public funds to catalyze private investment in conservation.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Conclusion\n",
            "The strategic importance of innovative finance for nature conservation cannot be overstated. The INRM Conservation Finance Roundtable has laid the groundwork for future endeavors in the LAC region, providing a blueprint for action that can lead to meaningful environmental and economic benefits.

            "## Purpose and Scope\n",
            "The fourth Innovative Finance for Nature Roundtable Series, convened at the AmCham Center under the stewardship of Mark Bollick, is a strategic initiative designed to foster meaningful dialogues and collaborative efforts between the United States government and the private sector. The focus of these discussions is on identifying and advancing conservation finance solutions that can effectively contribute to the preservation and sustainability of natural ecosystems. This roundtable aims to articulate a shared understanding and explore synergistic opportunities for investments that can support conservation efforts, particularly in the context of nature-based finance.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Overview of Agenda\n",
            "The roundtable's agenda was meticulously structured to facilitate a comprehensive exploration of conservation finance. It encompassed a series of presentations from esteemed representatives of the Department of State, the Development Finance Corporation, and USAID. Participants were also engaged in interactive activities, including the creation of story posters that narrate the financial projects or models they represent. The use of an 'idea card' was introduced as a novel method for capturing the collective wisdom and proposals emanating from the roundtable discussions, ensuring that these insights are documented for inclusion in the final report.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Introduction of Team and Participants\n",
            "The facilitation team was led by Mark Bollick, whose expertise in guiding such discussions was instrumental in achieving the roundtable's objectives. The participants represented a diverse cross-section of stakeholders, including government officials, financial experts, conservation practitioners, and policy advocates. This diversity was pivotal in enriching the discussions with a wide range of perspectives and experiences, thus enhancing the depth and breadth of the roundtable's outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Workshop Objectives\n",
            "The workshop was not merely a forum for information exchange but was designed to foster 'creative abrasion'—a process where differences of opinion are not only expected but encouraged as a means to stimulate innovation and deeper understanding. The ultimate aim was to build trust in the collaborative process, with a focus on long-term relationships and shared goals rather than immediate solutions. This approach was predicated on the belief that such trust and openness are the bedrock of successful and transformative conservation finance initiatives.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Facilitation Team and Participant Introduction\n",
            "The roundtable featured brief biographical sketches of key facilitators and speakers, providing participants with context on the expertise and perspectives that each contributor brought to the table. The methodology employed throughout the event was designed to maximize engagement and ensure that all participants could contribute meaningfully to the discussions. Expectations were set for active participation, with an emphasis on the collective endeavor to identify and address the most pressing challenges in conservation finance.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Introduction of Key Representatives\n",
            "Kathy Hamlin, representing USAID in Brazil, commenced the workshop by acknowledging the presence of esteemed representatives from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and the Department of State. She underscored the importance of these entities in the roundtable's discourse and urged attendees to actively engage with them to foster a collaborative environment conducive to meaningful exchanges throughout the event.\n",
            "\n",
            "### USAID's Focus in Brazil\n",
            "Hamlin delineated the strategic focus of USAID in Brazil, emphasizing the agency's commitment to environmental programming, biodiversity conservation, and climate initiatives. She spotlighted the Amazon Biodiversity Fund, managed by Impact Earth and Vox Capital, as a pivotal endeavor aimed at mobilizing resources for conservation efforts in the Amazon region. This fund is a testament to USAID's dedication to pioneering innovative financial mechanisms that can significantly contribute to the protection of critical ecosystems.\n",
            "\n",
            "### US Government's Commitment to Climate Action\n",
            "Hamlin articulated the United States government's unwavering commitment to addressing the climate crisis, referencing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as a landmark legislative achievement that underscores this dedication. She highlighted the government's comprehensive strategy to conserve global forests and combat deforestation, a plan that is integral to the broader climate action framework.\n",
            "\n",
            "### The Amazon Basin's Significance\n",
            "The Amazon Basin's role as a vital carbon sink was a focal point of Hamlin's address. She stressed the urgency of developing and implementing innovative, nature-based solutions to prevent further deforestation and degradation of this crucial ecosystem. The emphasis on the Amazon underscores its global significance and the need for concerted efforts to ensure its preservation.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendations for Workshop Engagement\n",
            "Hamlin encouraged attendees to leverage the workshop as a platform for learning and discovery. She advised participants to identify gaps in assistance where the US government's support could be instrumental and to maximize the opportunity by engaging in inquisitive dialogue and robust networking.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Quotations\n",
            "Hamlin's remarks were punctuated by poignant quotations that captured the essence of the US government's stance on the climate crisis and the pivotal role of the Amazon Basin in global carbon sequestration efforts:\n",
            "- \"The US government is really focused on the climate crisis right now. From the commitments of COP26, the US government has been deploying a whole-of-government effort to scale up action to address the climate crisis.\"\n",
            "- \"As you are aware, the Amazon Basin is one of the world's most important carbon sinks. But the deforestation and land use change are putting this critical resource at risk, which is why we must act swiftly to develop solutions that can preserve this invaluable asset.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "## Mark Crotto's Address\n",
            "\n",
            "### Global Experience and Impact\n",
            "Mark Crotto, AID's mission director in Brazil, shared reflections on his extensive global experience, including his instrumental role in Power Africa, an initiative aimed at electrifying millions across the African continent. He conveyed the profound global impact of the work being undertaken in the Amazon biome, emphasizing the broader implications for environmental sustainability and climate resilience.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Creativity and Financial Systems\n",
            "Crotto underscored the necessity of working creatively within the financial system to address conservation challenges. He advocated for a deep understanding of the financial tools required to achieve effective outcomes and highlighted the importance of listening as a fundamental component of this creative process.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendations for Enhancing Effectiveness\n",
            "Crotto offered recommendations for developing creative financial solutions to achieve conservation goals. He called for a thoughtful consideration of the tools that AID and the US government could provide to support market solutions, such as feasibility studies, legal frameworks, and programs tailored to work with indigenous communities.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Quotations\n",
            "Crotto's address was marked by compelling quotations that emphasized the role of creativity, passion, and the power of financial mechanisms in mission-driven work:\n",
            "- \"The creativity that is here, the kind of partners we get to work with is kind of unbelievable. Every day what we have to do, the passion for mission for me is a big, big motivator, as I'm sure it is for most people.\"\n",
            "- \"Money drives the world, right? And that's not a good or a bad thing, it's a thing, right? This is the structure we have, the system we have, and we have to figure out ways, creatively, to work together better.\"\n",
